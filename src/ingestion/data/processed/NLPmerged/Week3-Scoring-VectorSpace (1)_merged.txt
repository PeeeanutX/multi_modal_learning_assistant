From Boolean to ranked retrieval
4
So far: Boolean queries →Documents either match or don’t. 
Good for
•
expert users (precise understanding of the need and collection)
•
applications (easy consumption of 1000s of results)
Not good for
•
most users (unwilling/incapable to write Boolean queries)
•
web search
Search engine: rank-order the documents matching a query.

Ranked retrieval
5
The system returns an ordering of the top documents in the collection. 
Typically, free text queries: more than one word in natural language (no 
operators etc.)
→If search algorithm works, large sets are not a problem anymore (or at 
least, should not be): 
•
rank result according to usefulness to the user
•
only top k results are shown

[PAGE 6]
Universität Konstanz
Ranked retrieval
So far: Document = sequence of terms
But: Most documents have additional structure. 
One option: Parametric and zone indexes – they make use of this 
additional structure.

The parametric index
7
A parametric index is an index that allows retrieval of documents based on 
the values of parameters. It serves as an extension of the collection’s word 
index.

The parametric index
Make use of metadata associated with each document. 
Fields, e.g. date of creation, with a (finite) set of possible values, e.g. the 
set of all dates of authorship. 
Each field has one parametric index. 
Date of publication index:  
1601 
→1   →2
1602 
→3   →4
1932 
→5   →6
Allows us to to select only the documents matching a data specified in the 
query.

Zone indexes
Zones are similar to fields, except the contents of a zone can be arbitrary 
free text. They are encoded as extensions of dictionary entries.

Ranked retrieval without zones
10
The system returns an ordering over the top documents in the collection for 
a query. 
Queries without any operators, formulated in natural language. 
Scoring is the basis of ranked retrieval:
•
assign a score to a query/document pair, based on the weight of the 
query in the document. 
•
aka: the higher the score, the more relevant the document is to the 
query.

Using the Jaccard coefficient
Measuring the similarity of two sets A (the query) and B (the document) with 
a number between 0 and 1. 
J(A, B) = | A ⋂B | / | A ⋃B| 
J(A, A) = 1
J(A, B) = 0 if A ⋂B = 0
A and B do not have to have the same size.

Term frequency
Term frequency tft,d of term t in document d is the number of times that t 
occurs in d. 
But: absolute frequencies are not what we want. 
•
Not all terms are equally important. 
•
A document with 10 occurrences is more relevant than a document 
with one occurrence. 
•
But not 10 times more relevant. 
Relevance does not increase proportionally with term frequency. 
→Reduce the effect of term frequency in determining relevant docs.

Term frequency

otherwise

Term frequency
18
Occurrence of each term (`term frequency’) is central.
E.g., John is quicker than Mary has the same vector as Mary is quicker 
than John. 
But the assumption is: two documents with similar bag of words 
representations are similar in content.

[PAGE 19]
Universität Konstanz
Collection frequency versus document frequency
We need to scale down the weight of tf in determining relevant documents. 
In other words, we need a weight for each term in the document which 
reflects how much this term helps in distinguishing a document from all 
other documents in the collection.
Two possibilities: 
•
Collection frequency (cf): the total number of occurrences of term t in the 
collection. 
•
Document frequency (df): the number of documents in the collection that 
contain a term t.

Inverse document frequency (idf)
21
Document frequency dft is an inverse measure of the informativeness of t 
→the higher the document frequency (df), the lower the informativeness of 
term t. 
idft = log10 (N
dft)
N is the number of documents in the collection.
Log (N
dft) reduces the effect of the idf weight on the overall term weight.

tf-idf
23
TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document frequency) 
tf-idft,d = tft,d x idft
Best-know weighting scheme in information retrieval
•
the “-” in tf-idf is a hyphen, not a minus sign!
•
alternative names: tf.idf, tf x idf
•
increases with the number of occurrences within a document
•
increases with the rarity of the term in the collection

[PAGE 24]
Universität Konstanz
tf-idf
24
In other words…
•
term frequency: how many times a term occurs in a document. 
(Assumption: a document containing many times a given word, is likely 
to be about that word) 
•
inverse document frequency: how many documents in the collection 
contain a term. (Assumption: if a term occurs in many documents, it is 
not very discriminative.) 
A survey conducted by Breitinger et al. in 2015 shows that 83% of text-
based recommender systems in digital libraries use tf–idf.

Score for a document given a query
25
score(q,d) = σ𝑡∈𝑞tf−idft,d
The sum of tf-idf weights for all terms in the query q that are matching in  
document d. 
Different weighting schemes for tf and idf available. We use here: 
wt,d = (1 + log10 tft,d) x log10 (N
dft)

This is a vector (𝑉(z)) defined over the coordinate axes x and y. 
In IR, vectors are used to represent terms and documents. 
Each document is a vector defined over co-ordinate axes; the co-ordinate 
axes are the terms contained in the document. 
High-dimensional: tens of millions of dimensions when you apply this to a 
web search engine (but: very sparse vectors - most entries are zero).

tf-idf weights are used to characterize the documents. 
The denominator normalizes vectors of different lengths →allows us to 
compare documents of different lengths.

A vector is normalized by dividing each of its components by its length. 
(𝑉(x)) = [ 3 1 2] 
|x| = 9 + 1 + 4 = 3,724

Instead of comparing 𝑉(d1) to 𝑉(d2), we can compare 𝑉(d) to 𝑉(q), where 
𝑉(d) is every document in our index, and 𝑉(q) is a query. 
Given a query q, all the documents in the collection can be ranked 
according to their similarity score sim(q,d). The higher the similarity, the 
more relevant the document to the query.
