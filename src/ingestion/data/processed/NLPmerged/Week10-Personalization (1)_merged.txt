Assessing relevance
Given information needs and documents, you need to collect relevance 
assessments by humans. 
Standard approach: Pooling, i.e., relevance is assessed over a subset of 
the collection that is formed from the top k documents returned by a 
number of different IR systems. 
Humans and their relevance judgements are quite idiosyncratic and 
variable ‚Üíneed to measure how much agreement between judges there 
is.

Kappa statistic
Kappa = ùëÉùê¥‚àíùëÉ(ùê∏)
1 ‚àíùëÉ(ùê∏)
P(A) is the observed agreement. 
P(E) is the expected agreement. 
Kappa = 1 if two judges always agree. 
Kappa = 0 if two judges agree at the rate given by chance. 
Kappa < 0 if two judges agree worse than at random. 
In a two-class decision, P(E) = 0.5. But normally, class distribution is 
skewed, therefore we use marginal statistics to calculate P(E).

Calculate P(A), P(relevant), P(non-relevant), P(E) and kappa.

User behavior
Adapt ranking to user clicks? But there is a strong position bias, so 
absolute click rates are unreliable.

Higher positions receive more 
user attention (eye fixation) and 
clicks than lower positions.
This is true even in the extreme 
setting where the order of 
positions is reversed.

A/B test 
Common practice to test modern search engine systems.
Two-sample hypothesis testing:
‚Ä¢
Two versions (A and B) of a system are compared, which are 
identical except for one variation that might affect a user's behavior, 
e.g., BM25 with different parameter settings
‚Ä¢
Randomized experiment
‚Ä¢
Separate the population into equal size groups ‚Äì 10% random 
users for system A and 10% random users for system B
‚Ä¢
Null hypothesis: no difference between system A and B

Behavior-based metrics:
‚Ä¢
Abandonment Rate: fraction of queries for which no results are 
clicked on
‚Ä¢
Reformulation Rate: fraction of queries that are followed by another 
query during the same session
‚Ä¢
Queries per Session: mean number of queries issued by a user 
during a session
‚Ä¢
Clicks per Query: mean number of results that are clicked for each 
query
‚Ä¢
Time to First/Last Click: mean time from query being issued until last 
click on any result

Potential for personalization
Teevan, Dumais, Horvitz 2010:
Aim: Quantify the variation in relevance for the same query across different 
individuals. 
Explicit judgements from different people:
‚Ä¢
ask raters to explicitly rate a set of queries
‚Ä¢
but rather than asking them to guess what a user‚Äôs information need 
might be ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢
... ask which results they would personally consider relevant
‚Ä¢
use self-generated and pre-generated queries

Recap: Discounted cumulative gain
Popular measure for evaluating web search and related tasks. 
Two assumptions:
1.
Highly relevant documents are more useful than marginally relevant 
documents. 
2.
The lower the ranked position of a relevant document, the less 
useful it is for the user, since it‚Äôs less likely to be examined. 
Focus on retrieving highly relevant documents.

[PAGE 22]
Universit√§t Konstanz
Recap: Discounted cumulative gain
22
Designed for non-binary notions of relevance. 
Uses graded relevance as a measure of usefulness, or gain, from 
examining a document. 
Gain is accumulated starting at the top of the ranking and may be reduced, 
or discounted, at lower ranks.

Recap: Discounted cumulative gain

Summarize a ranking:
‚Ä¢
Imagine the relevance judgements are on a scale of [0, r], with r > 2. 
‚Ä¢
Cumulative gain (CG) at rank n
‚Ä¢
The ratings of the n documents are r1, r2, r3, ‚Ä¶, rn
‚Ä¢
CG = r1 + r2  + r3 + ‚Ä¶ + rn
‚Ä¢
Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) at rank n
‚Ä¢
DCG = r1 + r2 /log22 + r3/log23 + ‚Ä¶ + rn/log2i

Example:
There are 10 ranked documents judged on a 0-3 relevance scale:
3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0
Compute the discounted gain and the DCG for all ranks (logarithm with 
base 2).

Liu et al. 2019. Personalization in text information retrieval: A survey. 
Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. 
‚ÄúPersonalization is aimed at tailoring search toward individual users and 
user groups by taking into account additional information about users 
besides their queries.‚Äù 
Started about 10-15 years ago, rich effort in industry and academia.

Personalizing search
Pitkow et al. 2002: Two general ways of personalizing search
Query expansion:
‚Ä¢
modify or augment user query
‚Ä¢
e.g., query term ‚ÄúIR‚Äù can be augmented with either ‚Äúinformation 
retrieval‚Äù or ‚ÄúIngersoll-Rand‚Äù depending on user interest
‚Ä¢
ensures that there are enough personalized results
Reranking:
‚Ä¢
issue the same query and fetch the same results ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¶ but rerank the results based on a user profile
‚Ä¢
allows both personalized and globally relevant results

Personalization via location
User location is one of the most important features for personalization. 
‚Ä¢
country:
‚Ä¢
queries like ‚Äòfootball‚Äô and ‚Äòbiscuit‚Äô in the UK versus the US
‚Ä¢
state/metro/city:
‚Ä¢
queries like ‚Äòzoo‚Äô, ‚Äòcraigslist‚Äô, ‚ÄòEbay Kleinanzeigen‚Äô
‚Ä¢
fine-grained location:
‚Ä¢
queries like ‚Äòpizza‚Äô, ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô, ‚Äòcoffee shop‚Äô

Universit√§t Konstanz
Personalization via location
Not all queries are location sensitive:
‚Ä¢
‚Äòfacebook‚Äô is not asking for the closest Facebook office
‚Ä¢
‚Äònational park‚Äô is not necessarily asking for the closest national park
Different parts of a site may be more or less location sensitive
‚Ä¢
NYTimes home page vs NYTimes local section
Addresses on a page don‚Äôt always tell us how location sensitive the page is
‚Ä¢
University of Passau home page has address, but is not location 
sensitive.

Key idea in Bennett et al. 2011. 
Usage statistics, rather than locations mentioned in a document, best 
represent where it is relevant.
‚Üíif users in a location tend to click on that document, then it is relevant in 
that location
User location data is acquired from anonymized logs (with user consent, 
e.g., from a widely distributed browser extension). 
‚Üíuser IP addresses are resolved into geographic location information
