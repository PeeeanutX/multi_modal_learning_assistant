From Boolean to ranked retrieval
4
So far: Boolean queries →Documents either match or don’t. 
Good for
•
expert users (precise understanding of the need and collection)
•
applications (easy consumption of 1000s of results)
Not good for
•
most users (unwilling/incapable to write Boolean queries)
•
web search
Search engine: rank-order the documents matching a query.

[PAGE 5]
Universität Konstanz
Ranked retrieval
5
The system returns an ordering of the top documents in the collection. 
Typically, free text queries: more than one word in natural language (no 
operators etc.)
→If search algorithm works, large sets are not a problem anymore (or at 
least, should not be): 
•
rank result according to usefulness to the user
•
only top k results are shown

[PAGE 6]
Universität Konstanz
Ranked retrieval
So far: Document = sequence of terms
But: Most documents have additional structure. 
One option: Parametric and zone indexes – they make use of this 
additional structure.

[PAGE 7]
Universität Konstanz
The parametric index
7
A parametric index is an index that allows retrieval of documents based on 
the values of parameters. It serves as an extension of the collection’s word 
index.

[PAGE 8]
Universität Konstanz
The parametric index
Make use of metadata associated with each document. 
Fields, e.g. date of creation, with a (finite) set of possible values, e.g. the 
set of all dates of authorship. 
Each field has one parametric index. 
Date of publication index:  
1601 
→1   →2
1602 
→3   →4
1932 
→5   →6
Allows us to to select only the documents matching a data specified in the 
query.

[PAGE 9]
Universität Konstanz
Zone indexes
Zones are similar to fields, except the contents of a zone can be arbitrary 
free text. They are encoded as extensions of dictionary entries.

[PAGE 10]
Universität Konstanz
Ranked retrieval without zones
10
The system returns an ordering over the top documents in the collection for 
a query. 
Queries without any operators, formulated in natural language. 
Scoring is the basis of ranked retrieval:
•
assign a score to a query/document pair, based on the weight of the 
query in the document. 
•
aka: the higher the score, the more relevant the document is to the 
query.

A first take at ranking…
11
Using the Jaccard coefficient
Measuring the similarity of two sets A (the query) and B (the document) with 
a number between 0 and 1. 
J(A, B) = | A ⋂B | / | A ⋃B| 
J(A, A) = 1
J(A, B) = 0 if A ⋂B = 0
A and B do not have to have the same size.

Term frequency
Term frequency tft,d of term t in document d is the number of times that t 
occurs in d. 
But: absolute frequencies are not what we want. 
•
Not all terms are equally important. 
•
A document with 10 occurrences is more relevant than a document 
with one occurrence. 
•
But not 10 times more relevant. 
Relevance does not increase proportionally with term frequency. 
→Reduce the effect of term frequency in determining relevant docs.

Term frequency

otherwise

Term frequency
18
Occurrence of each term (`term frequency’) is central.
E.g., John is quicker than Mary has the same vector as Mary is quicker 
than John. 
But the assumption is: two documents with similar bag of words 
representations are similar in content.

[PAGE 19]
Universität Konstanz
Collection frequency versus document frequency
We need to scale down the weight of tf in determining relevant documents. 
In other words, we need a weight for each term in the document which 
reflects how much this term helps in distinguishing a document from all 
other documents in the collection.
Two possibilities: 
•
Collection frequency (cf): the total number of occurrences of term t in the 
collection. 
•
Document frequency (df): the number of documents in the collection that 
contain a term t.

Inverse document frequency (idf)
21
Document frequency dft is an inverse measure of the informativeness of t 
→the higher the document frequency (df), the lower the informativeness of 
term t. 
idft = log10 (N
dft)
N is the number of documents in the collection.
Log (N
dft) reduces the effect of the idf weight on the overall term weight.

tf-idf
23
TF-IDF (term frequency - inverse document frequency) 
tf-idft,d = tft,d x idft
Best-know weighting scheme in information retrieval
•
the “-” in tf-idf is a hyphen, not a minus sign!
•
alternative names: tf.idf, tf x idf
•
increases with the number of occurrences within a document
•
increases with the rarity of the term in the collection

[PAGE 24]
Universität Konstanz
tf-idf
24
In other words…
•
term frequency: how many times a term occurs in a document. 
(Assumption: a document containing many times a given word, is likely 
to be about that word) 
•
inverse document frequency: how many documents in the collection 
contain a term. (Assumption: if a term occurs in many documents, it is 
not very discriminative.) 
A survey conducted by Breitinger et al. in 2015 shows that 83% of text-
based recommender systems in digital libraries use tf–idf.

Score for a document given a query
25
score(q,d) = σ𝑡∈𝑞tf−idft,d
The sum of tf-idf weights for all terms in the query q that are matching in  
document d. 
Different weighting schemes for tf and idf available. We use here: 
wt,d = (1 + log10 tft,d) x log10 (N
dft)

This is a vector (𝑉(z)) defined over the coordinate axes x and y. 
In IR, vectors are used to represent terms and documents. 
Each document is a vector defined over co-ordinate axes; the co-ordinate 
axes are the terms contained in the document. 
High-dimensional: tens of millions of dimensions when you apply this to a 
web search engine (but: very sparse vectors - most entries are zero).

tf-idf weights are used to characterize the documents. 
The denominator normalizes vectors of different lengths →allows us to 
compare documents of different lengths.

Why normalizing for length?
Euclidean distance is large for vectors of different length.

Length normalization
31
A vector is normalized by dividing each of its components by its length. 
(𝑉(x)) = [ 3 1 2] 
|x| = 9 + 1 + 4 = 3,724

Instead of comparing 𝑉(d1) to 𝑉(d2), we can compare 𝑉(d) to 𝑉(q), where 
𝑉(d) is every document in our index, and 𝑉(q) is a query. 
Given a query q, all the documents in the collection can be ranked 
according to their similarity score sim(q,d). The higher the similarity, the 
more relevant the document to the query.
