Definition: Innovation
Rogers 2003
Innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as 
new by an individual or other unit of adoption.

Definition: Digital Innovation
Fichman et al. 2014; Nambisan et al. 2017
•
In digital innovation, IT plays the key role
–
This not only includes AI technology but also other types of technology 
(e.g., cloud infrastructure technology, database technology)
•
The perception of a digital innovation being “new” is also a matter of 
perspective:
–
For example, a small company might view adopting a CRM system as 
innovative, while larger companies may consider it a standard practice
Digital innovation is a product, process, or business model 
that is perceived as new, requires significant changes on the 
part of adopters, and is embodied in or enabled by information 
technology.

Types of Digital Innovation
Digital product innovations are 
significantly new products or 
services that are either 
embodied in IT or enabled by IT.
Digital business model innovations 
are significantly new ways of 
creating and capturing business 
value that is embodied in or 
enabled by IT.

We do not know precisely how human creativity works
•
While we tend to think that ideas come “out of the blue”, knowledge 
is usually an important requirement for creativity (e.g., knowledge of 
certain technologies or markets)
•
There are many techniques (e.g., brainstorming) and tools (e.g., 
digital mind maps) to foster creativity
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems

Creativity
Creativity is the capacity to produce something – either abstract 
or physical – that is (1) new and (2) valuable.

AI-Enabled Innovation
•
AI technologies and algorithms (e.g., deep learning) can 
facilitate the creative interpretation of data and support 
decision-making within the innovation process (e.g., 
evaluating and selecting ideas)
•
Although AI technologies may not yet be able to 
independently develop entire solutions (e.g., new 
products), they can point humans toward the most 
promising avenues for innovation
AI-enabled innovation refers to the use of AI to generate, 
evaluate, refine, and implement ideas for new or altered 
products, processes, or business models.

Customer feedback in online reviews, 
social media comments, etc. provides a 
valuable source of information about 
unmet needs, changing preferences, and 
current pain points
•
This information can inspire new 
features, products, and even business 
models
•
Natural language processing (NLP) 
techniques can be used to analyze the 
vast amounts of unstructured data and 
extract insights:
–
For example, if a software company 
notices that many reviews request 
“mobile compatibility”, it may prioritize the 
development of a native mobile app

Challenges of AI-Enabled Innovation
Innovation vs. Imitation:
Can AI truly innovate, or 
just imitate?
Data Dependency:
No AI-enabled innovation 
without data
Authorship Questions:
Who should be granted 
authorship of AI-enabled 
innovations?

Researchers tested how AI’s ability to imitate and innovate 
differs from that of children and adults:
•
In one task, participants were asked how they could draw 
a circle without using a typical tool such as a compass 
(German: Zirkel). Given the choice between a similar tool 
like a ruler, a dissimilar tool such as a teapot with a round 
bottom, and an irrelevant tool such as a stove, 85% of 
children and 95% of adults chose the teapot, a 
conceptually dissimilar tool that could nonetheless fulfill 
the same function as the compass by allowing them to 
trace the shape of a circle.
•
When the same text description was provided to five large 
language models, their performance was much lower: 
Effective tools were selected anywhere from 8% of the 
time by the worst-performing model to 75% by the 
best-performing model

Innovation vs. Imitation
“AI can help transmit information that is 
already known, but it is not an innovator 
[…] These models can summarize 
conventional wisdom, but they cannot 
expand, create, change, abandon, 
evaluate, and improve on conventional 
wisdom in the way a young human can.”
Yiu et al. 2024

•
AI needs large amounts of training data to generate, 
discover, and recognize new creative ideas and 
opportunities
•
What about domains where no or only limited (high-
quality) data is available?
–
Healthcare (e.g., lack of data on rare diseases)
–
Finance (e.g., privacy regulations limit the sharing of 
sensitive customer data)
–
…
•
AI-enabled innovation will mostly benefit domains where 
abundant data are available →domains for which 
limited data are available are not well-suited for AI

Authorship of AI-Enabled Innovations
Who should be granted authorship of innovations 
enabled through AI?
• User of the AI
• Company that the AI user works for
• Developer of the AI
• Provider of the AI’s training data
• AI itself
• …?

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
(Digital) innovation is something that is perceived as new:
1.
New product or service
2.
New (business) process
3.
New business model
•
The innovation process consists of three basic steps: ideation, 
development, and implementation
•
Creativity plays an essential role in this process →AI can augment human 
creativity and might even produce more novel ideas than humans
•
AI can be used to enhance various activities in the innovation process: 
market research, idea generation, prototype testing, marketing, …
•
However, the use of AI for innovation raises important questions:
–
Can AI truly innovate, or just imitate?
–
What about domains where no or only limited (high-quality) training data is 
available?
–
Who should be granted authorship of AI-enabled innovations?
