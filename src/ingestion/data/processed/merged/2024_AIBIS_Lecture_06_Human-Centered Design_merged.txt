A human-centered design approach should 
follow these principles:
1. the design is based upon an explicit 
understanding of users, tasks and environments
2. Users are involved throughout design and 
development
3. the design is driven and refined by user-centered 
evaluation
4. the process is iterative
5. the design addresses the whole user experience
6. the design team includes multidisciplinary skills 
and perspectives

The context of use has the following 
components: 
– Users (people who interact with the system)
– Goals (what users want to achieve) 
– Tasks (what users do to achieve their goals) 
– Context (in which the interaction takes place)
– Resources (the means required to perform the 
task)

Example:
“John Doe is an IT consultant who frequently shops for groceries 
online due to his busy schedule. He prefers to use the same grocery 
delivery service because it allows him to quickly reorder items from 
his past purchases. However, every so often, he forgets to check the 
delivery time slots. This often results in frustration when he realizes 
his preferred delivery window is already fully booked, causing him to 
wait much longer for groceries to arrive than expected.”

As-Is Scenario

•
The purpose of user needs is to serve as a helpful intermediate step in the transformation of the 
context of use information into user requirements
•
Each component of the context of use (users, goals, tasks, resources, etc.) can be a source for 
user needs
•
User needs are independent of any proposed solution for each need 
–
→A user need must not refer to, for example, “the system” or “the website”
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
23
User Need
A prerequisite identified as necessary for a user, or a user group, to 
achieve a goal, implied or stated within a specific context of use.

Example: Identifying User Needs in Context of Use Information 
Context of Use
Identified User Needs
Patients often have to wait for treatment 
beyond the agreed time of their appointment. 
Being forced to wait is very annoying for 
patients, especially when they have to sit in the 
waiting room for up to 90 minutes without any 
clear indication of how long it will be until it is 
their turn.
The patient needs to know when their 
scheduled appointment will in fact begin 
before arriving at the doctor’s office in order to
make good use of the time remaining.
Patients often make appointments well in 
advance, because good doctors are not 
available at short notice.
The patient needs to have an appointment to 
ensure they receive treatment at the agreed 
time.

•
User requirements are precise criteria from the users’ point of view that must be met by the 
system before its release
•
User requirements are derived from user needs
–
For simple systems, user requirements can be derived directly from the context of use description 
without first identifying and documenting user needs
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
25
User Requirement
A requirement for use that provides the basis for design and 
evaluation of a system to meet user needs.
UXQB 2022

•
Qualitative user requirements address the way in which the system is 
used to arrive at a user goal
•
Quantitative user requirements set measurable quality objectives
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
26
Qualitative vs. Quantitative User Requirements
Quantitative: A required level of usability to meet identified user needs expressed in 
terms of measures of effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, accessibility, user 
experience and avoidance of harm from use in a specified context of use.
Qualitative: A statement of what users must be able to locate, recognize, understand, 
select or input as part of conducting a task with the system to meet identified user needs 
in a specified context of use.
UXQB 2022

[IMAGE CAPTION] the university of passau logo

[PAGE 27]
Qualitative User Requirements
Syntax rule:
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize / select / input / … <information or 
resource> under <optional condition>.
Example “Shopping Website”:
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize which products are in his/her 
shopping basket (information), before starting 
the payment process (condition).
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
27
Formulating User Requirements
Quantitative User Requirements
Quantitative user requirements can be formulated by 
taking the following components into consideration: 
•
The user group(s) who must fulfil the requirement 
during use 
•
The number or percentage of users who must 
fulfil the requirement during use 
•
The units of measurement (e.g., task time, error 
rate, precision)
Example “Shopping Website”:
After completing their shopping process, 80% of users 
must answer ‘Agree’ or ‘Strongly agree’ to the 
statement ‘The shopping website is easy to use’. 
(satisfaction)

Derived User Requirements
The patient needs to know when their 
scheduled appointment will in fact begin 
before arriving at the doctor’s office in order 
to make good use of the time remaining.
•
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize that a scheduled appointment will 
be delayed.
•
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize for how long the scheduled 
appointment will be delayed.
The patient needs to have an 
appointment to ensure they receive 
treatment at the agreed time.
•
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize which dates and times are available 
for appointments.
•
With the system, the user must be able to select 
a date and time for the appointment.

High-fidelity prototypes are computer-based, and usually allow realistic (mouse/keyboard) user 
interactions
–
Created using tools like Figma
•
High-fidelity prototypes take you as close as possible to a true representation of the user interface
•
After a successful evaluation, the high-fidelity prototype informs the development of the system
UXQB 2022

User Survey
A usability evaluation where users are asked to complete a 
questionnaire about their experience of using a system.
UXQB 2022; Brooke 1996
•
Questionnaire: a set of questions that is used to 
collect data from users
–
Open questions: Where did you encounter problems?
–
Closed questions: On a scale from 1 to 5, please rate 
how satisfied you are with the system
•
A significant number of responses (100+) is required 
for them to be statistically reliable
Example “System Usability Scale” (SUS)

•
Usability inspection is often performed by UX professionals or subject matter experts, who 
base their judgement on prior experience of usability problems encountered by users and their 
own knowledge of design guidelines and principles
•
Unlike usability tests and user surveys, usability inspections do not involve users
•
Why? Evaluation by users is not always possible or cost-effective at every stage of the project

Usability Inspection
A usability evaluation based on the judgment of one or more 
evaluators who examine or use a system to identify potential

Key Takeaways
•
It is important to involve humans in the design of AI-
based information systems
•
A human-centered design approach consists four key 
activities that are performed iteratively:
–
Analyze
–
Specify
–
Design
–
Evaluate
•
For each activity, there are different methods, tools, and 
techniques, which result in key deliverables for the next 
activity
