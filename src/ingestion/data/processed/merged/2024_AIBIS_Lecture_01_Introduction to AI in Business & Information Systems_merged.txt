Learning Goals
•
Define artificial intelligence (AI) based on the two 
dimensions of capability (thinking vs. acting) and 
performance (human vs. rational)
•
Describe the key elements of an AI-based 
business information system and explain how 
they are related to each other
•
Explain how AI-based business information 
systems are different from more traditional 
business information systems
•
Explain why it is useful to look at AI through the 
lens of business capabilities rather than 
technologies

Technical Perspective on AI Systems
An AI system is a machine-based system that […] infers, from 
the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as 
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can 
influence physical or virtual environments. (based on OECD 2019)

The terms “human” and “user” are often used interchangeably
•
This role not only includes people who directly interact with the AI technology (“users”) but 
also those affected by it in some way

It also includes those involved in the planning, design and development, implementation and 
introduction, and maintenance of the AI system

sometimes even without human knowledge!)

Robotic process automation (RPA) bots that log into ERP 
systems and automatically execute business processes

•
Previous generations of business information systems had 
limited ability to automatically improve through data and 
experience
•
AI advances have enabled the learning capacity of AI-based 
business information systems to evolve from basic approaches 
for inductive learning to large-scale approaches (e.g., deep 
learning)
•
Examples:
–
Product recommendation systems that learn from customers’ 
shopping behavior in real time
–
Predictive maintenance software in manufacturing plants that 
learns from previous errors and breakdowns
–
AI-driven recruitment systems that learn from previous successful 
hires

•
AI-based business information systems and their outputs often are 
intelligible only to a select audience (e.g., developers, data 
scientists)
•
For others, such as managers or business users, they can be a 
“black box”
•
Examples:
–
AI-based credit and loan decisions that are difficult to understand for 
financial advisors in a bank
–
AI-based sales forecasts that are difficult to understand for sales 
managers 
–
AI-based therapy recommendations that are difficult to understand 
for medical professionals

•
Autonomy, learning, and inscrutability are 
interdependent facets that feed into each 
other:
–
Learning contributes to, and results from, 
autonomy
–
Both autonomy and learning result in 
inscrutability
•
The levels of autonomy, learning, and 
inscrutability continue to increase!

Business Capabilities
•
Ask: What business needs and objectives can AI support? How and where 
can AI be used to enhance core business activities or enable new ones?
•
Instead of: Which data could we use for machine learning? How can we 
leverage large language models?
Business capabilities refer to the core activities and competencies 
that enable an organization to achieve its business objectives and 
deliver value to its stakeholders. (based on Margherita 2014)

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
There is no single, agreed-upon definition of AI, but one way to 
define AI is to consider the two dimensions of capability 
(thinking vs. acting) and performance (human vs. rational)
•
AI-based (business) information systems are socio-technical 
systems: It is not only about the AI system but also about 
humans, tasks, goals, and outcomes
•
AI-based business information systems are different from more 
traditional business information systems in three facets: 
autonomy, learning, and inscrutability
•
AI-based information systems enable different (and sometimes 
multiple) business capabilities: 
–
Automation, engagement, insights & decisions, innovation
