•
Reducing uncertainty by gathering information about all 
alternatives is crucial 
•
Uncertainty can only be reduced, not eliminated
•
Very few decisions are made with absolute certainty 
because complete knowledge about all the alternatives 
is seldom possible!

Decision-Making
Decision-making is the process of sufficiently reducing 
uncertainty and doubt about alternatives to allow a reasonable 
choice to be made from among them.

Top-Down, Knowledge-Driven Paradigm
•
Human experts have used their intelligence to develop a high level of expertise in a particular domain by 
training, education, and learning from experience
•
The top-down, knowledge-driven paradigm seeks to “transfer” as much of this expert knowledge as possible 
to machines
•
Consequently, these systems are often called “expert systems”

Expert Systems

[IMAGE CAPTION] the university of passau logo

[PAGE 17]
Logo of the University of Passau
•
Their main goal is to simulate the decision-making skills of human experts in very specific 
domains by using hard-coded rules (e.g., “if-then” statements) and logical inference techniques
•
Expert systems emerged in the 1970s as a breakthrough in AI research
•
They were the dominant AI technology in the 1980s but disappeared in the 1990s →Today, they 
are often not considered AI anymore
•
The term “expert system” was used interchangeably with “knowledge-based system”
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
17
Expert Systems
Expert systems are computer programs designed to assist in 
decision-making by reasoning through knowledge captured 
from human experts within a specific domain.
El-Najdawi & Stylianou 1993

[IMAGE CAPTION] the university of passau logo

[IMAGE CAPTION] a close up of a dictionary with a red word definition

[PAGE 18]
Logo of the University of Passau
•
Expert systems have three main components:
1. A knowledge base consisting of knowledge captured from an expert in the domain, encoded into 
facts, rules, and relationships
2. An inference engine that processes information from the knowledge base, applies logical 
reasoning techniques, and generates recommendations
3. A user interface that allows non-experts to interact with and receive advice or recommendations 
from the system
•
Sometimes, an “explanation facility” component was included to help users understand the reasoning 
process of the system

•
Developing an expert system is known as knowledge 
engineering, and its practitioners are called knowledge 
engineers
•
Knowledge engineers typically follow this process:
1. Interviewing and observing human experts
2. Learning what the experts know and how they reason 
with their knowledge
3. Translating this knowledge into a set of rules
4. Loading these rules into an inference engine and 
running them against test cases
5. Consulting with human experts to determine what 
changes need to be made

•
One of the best-known expert systems 
is MYCIN (developed in the 1970s)
•
It was designed to provide advice for 
physicians regarding diagnosis and 
therapy for infectious diseases
•
MYCIN’s medical knowledge was 
encoded in a set of rules that 
represent a single, independent 
“chunk” of domain-specific knowledge
•
A consultation was run by backward 
chaining through applicable rules

The first successful commercial expert system 
was R1
•
Developed by John McDermott of Carnegie 
Mellon University and used by Digital 
Equipment Corporation (DEC; later bought by 
HP)
•
R1 helped configure orders for new computer 
systems based on 2500 rules
•
By 1986, it had processed 80,000 orders and 
was saving DEC an estimated $40 million a 
year
•
By 1988, DEC had 40 expert systems deployed 
•
McDermott’s 1982 paper on R1 won the AAAI 
Classic Paper Award in 1999

•
The development of expert systems marked a 
turning point in the history of AI
•
They served as proof that AI systems could be 
used in real-life systems and had the potential to 
provide significant benefits to businesses
•
Expert systems generated a lot of hype, and the AI 
industry boomed from a few million dollars in 1980 
to billions of dollars in 1988:
–
“Expert system startups were mushrooming, large 
corporations were rushing to establish AI groups, 
government money was flooding in, and a frenzied 
job market ensured lucrative employment for 
anyone who could claim a few months of AI 
experience”
•
However, expert systems failed to deliver on their 
overhyped promises, resulting in a significant 
slowdown of business interest and investments

•
While expert systems did well in narrow problem domains, 
they struggled when faced with a situation outside their 
knowledge base:
–
They could not learn new knowledge on their own (e.g., 
generate new rules) and were reliant on human experts and 
programmers to make adjustments
–
Keeping them up to date was time-consuming (→costs) and 
difficult (→skilled knowledge engineers)
•
Complex tasks often require tacit knowledge that experts 
find hard to codify
•
Decision-makers (e.g., doctors) were reluctant to trust 
computer-generated advice (e.g., a diagnosis) over their 
gut instinct

Bottom-Up, Data-Driven Paradigm
•
In the 1990s, there is a shift from a knowledge-driven paradigm to a data-driven paradigm
•
In the bottom-up data-driven paradigm, algorithms discover patterns and learn their own rules from data 
(“training data”)
•
Their “machine knowledge” is acquired without relying on input or instruction from human domain experts

The field of machine learning has been inspired by the idea that humans learn 
through experience (e.g., by examples or by interacting with the environment)
•
Machine learning algorithms iteratively learn from problem-specific training data, 
which allows them to find hidden insights and recognize complex patterns 
–
Range from very simple (e.g., linear regression) to highly complex (e.g., neural 
networks)
•
In the 2010s, deep learning became feasible, which led to machine learning 
becoming the mainstream AI technology

Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses 
algorithms trained on data sets to create models that enable 
machines to perform tasks without explicit instructions.

The goal of predictive maintenance is to 
catch breakdowns before they happen by 
monitoring equipment conditions
–
Typically relies on sensor data enabled 
by Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology
•
When historical data from machine 
operations is available, supervised 
learning techniques can be employed to 
predict when a failure will occur and to 
estimate the machine’s remaining useful 
life
•
Predictive maintenance allows 
maintenance measures to be organized 
more efficiently and downtimes to be 
almost completely avoided

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
Decision-making is vital to the success of any business but can 
often be challenging →AI can be used to provide insights and 
support decision-making
•
There are two paradigms of AI-enabled insights & decisions: 
knowledge-driven (top-down) and data-driven (bottom-up)
•
The knowledge-driven paradigm focuses on encoded human 
knowledge and rule-based logic (e.g., handcrafted rules) 
–
Expert systems based on this paradigm gained popularity in the 
1980s but eventually disappeared due to significant challenges 
(e.g., high maintenance costs, inability to capture tacit knowledge)
•
In contrast, the data-driven paradigm allows algorithms to 
discover and learn knowledge directly from large datasets
–
Machine learning, the dominant technology in this paradigm, has 
become the cornerstone of modern AI
•
Despite advancements in AI, decision-makers often still rely on 
their instincts rather than on AI-enabled insights and 
recommendations →Changes to an organization’s decision-
making culture are needed
