Description
1. Design, data 
and modelling
•
Planning and design involves articulating the system’s concept and objectives, 
underlying assumptions, context and requirements, and potentially building a 
prototype.
•
Data collection and processing includes gathering and cleaning data, performing 
checks for completeness and quality, and documenting the dataset. 
•
Model building and interpretation involves the creation or selection of models or 
algorithms, their calibration and/or training and interpretation.
2. Verification 
and validation
… involves executing and tuning models, with tests to assess performance across various 
dimensions and considerations. 
3. Deployment
… involves piloting, checking compatibility with legacy systems, ensuring regulatory 
compliance, managing organizational change and evaluating user experience. 
4. Operation 
and monitoring
… involves operating the AI system and continuously assessing its recommendations and 
impacts (both intended and unintended) in light of objectives and ethical considerations.
