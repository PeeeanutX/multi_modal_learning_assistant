Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
Designing and managing AI is different from designing and 
managing more traditional business information systems
•
Many process models exist that offer guidance on how to 
design AI-based business information systems (e.g., OECD’s AI 
system lifecycle, CRISP-DM)
•
There are many design principles and guidelines for (AI-based) 
information systems, some of which specifically address AI-
related design challenges (e.g., ethical concerns)
•
The management of AI presents challenges to organizations at 
every level:
–
Strategic level (e.g., impact of AI on business strategy and 
workforce)
–
Tactical level (e.g., introduction of new AI-based systems)
–
Operational level (e.g., employees’ perception of and interaction 
with a newly introduced AI-based system)
•
There are common strategies and tactics for addressing these 
challenges (e.g., upskilling and reskilling programs)
