“In 1950, Alan Turing proposed an “imitation game” as the ultimate test of 
whether a machine was intelligent: could a machine imitate a human so well 
that its answers to questions are indistinguishable from those of a human. 
Ever since, creating intelligence that matches human intelligence has 
implicitly or explicitly been the goal of thousands of researchers, engineers 
and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like artificial intelligence 
include soaring productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most 
profoundly, a better understanding of our own minds.”
