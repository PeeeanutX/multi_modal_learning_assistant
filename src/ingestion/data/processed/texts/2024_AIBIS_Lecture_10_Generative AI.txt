Definition: Generative AI
Generative AI is a type of AI that generates seemingly new, 
meaningful content, such as text, images, audio, or video, from 
training data.

Generative vs. Traditional AI
•
Generates new data that is 
similar to the data it was 
trained on
•
Understands the distribution 
of data and how likely a given 
example is
Goal: Generate new data 
instances
•
Typically trained on a dataset 
of unlabeled data                   
(→unsupervised ML)
•
Learns the boundary between 
different classes or categories 
in a dataset
Goal: Discriminate between 
different kinds of data instances

Discriminative AI
•
Typically trained on a dataset 
of labeled data

•
Learns the relationship 
between the features of the 
data instances and the labels
Goal: Make predictions about

Foundation Models
A foundation model is an AI model trained with a large amount of 
data using self-supervision at scale, displays significant generality, 
and is capable of performing a wide range of distinct tasks.

Foundation Models: Examples
Trained on extensive textual 
data, learning to predict the next 
word in a sentence and 
generate coherent text
Examples: BERT, GPT-3, Llama
Trained on multiple modalities

LLM Demo & Token Sampling
Open the interactive LLM demo, explore how tokens are 
sampled under different parameter settings, and answer 
the following questions:
1.
What happens when the temperature is zero? What 
happens when it is set to its maximum value?
2.
Why do you think the temperature is typically set to a value 
between 0 and 1 by OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM 
providers?

•
Fine-tuning is a powerful technique but requires sufficiently large annotated training data which is often costly and hard to obtain
•
In practice, combinations of different techniques are often used
•
New techniques are constantly being developed (e.g., parameter-efficient fine-tuning; PEFT)

specific task or domain
Asking a pre-trained (foundation) 
model to perform a specific task 
by giving it a task description and 
relevant input data (=prompt)

Technique
Description
Example
Zero-shot 
promoting
Relying solely on a model’s pre-
trained information to answer a 
given prompt
•
Write a summary of the following text: […]
•
Generate ideas for a birthday present.
Few-shot 
prompting
Providing examples in the 
prompt, giving the model more 
context to improve its 
performance
Country: Germany
Capital city: Berlin
Country: Argentina
Capital city:
Chain-of-
thought 
prompting
Nudging a model to produce 
intermediate reasoning steps, 
thus improving the results on 
complex reasoning tasks
Two ways:
•
Use few-shot prompting by illustrating examples with 
detailed answers to questions
•
Add instructions such as “Let’s think step by step”

[PAGE 30]
Logo of the University of Passau
•
Prompting can seem easy, but 
designing effective prompts is 
challenging, especially for non-experts
•
Common challenges:
– Expectations stemming from human-to-
human communication (e.g., politeness)
– Tendency to overgeneralize
– Biases towards giving instruction over 
depicting examples

•
LLMs hallucinate because they operate mainly on a 
probabilistic level by putting one probable word in front of 
another without any deeper capacity for comprehension →
“Stochastic Parrots”
•
Like a parrot, LLMs excel at regurgitating learned content 
without knowing the meaning of their responses
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
37
Incorrect Outputs (“Hallucinations”)
Hannigan et al. 2024, Bender et al. 2021
A hallucination is when a language model generates seemingly 
realistic responses that are untrue, nonsensical, or unfaithful to 
the provided source input.

[PAGE 37]
Logo of the University of Passau
•
Humans might use untrue material created by generative 
AI in an uncritical and thoughtless way
•
This “botshit” makes it harder for people to know what is 
true and false in the world
•
Problems arise when the outputs have important 
consequences and cannot easily be verified
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
38
From Hallucinations to “Botshit”
Hannigan et al. 2024; McCarthy et al. 2024
Botshit is AI-generated content that is not grounded in truth (e.g., 
hallucinations) and is then uncritically used by a human for 
communication and decision-making tasks.

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
The primary way in which generative AI differs from 
traditional AI is that it can generate new data 
instances (new text, images, videos, etc.)
•
Foundation models are at the core of generative AI
•
Foundation models can be adapted to a wide range 
of specific tasks, for example, via fine-tuning or 
prompting
•
There are different prompting techniques (zero-shot, 
few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting) and a growing 
number of guidelines for effective prompt design
•
Generative AI offers many benefits but also creates 
several challenges such as hallucinations, biases, 
and copyright issues
