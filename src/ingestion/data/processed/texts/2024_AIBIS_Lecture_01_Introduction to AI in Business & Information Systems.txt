No singular, agreed-upon definition for AI
•
AI is not a technology or set of 
technologies, but a continually evolving 
frontier of emerging computing 
capabilities

Technical Perspective on AI Systems
An AI system is a machine-based system that […] infers, from 
the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as 
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can 
influence physical or virtual environments. (based on OECD 2019)

Tasks can be embedded in more complex structures 
(e.g., organizational structures)
•
Information technology (IT) can be any hard- or

Definition: Information System (IS)
Information systems are socio-technical systems composed of 
the interrelated elements of human, task, and technology.

Definition: AI-Based (Business) Information System
AI-based information systems are socio-technical systems in 
which humans perform tasks by using an AI system in a specific 
context to achieve specific goals and outcomes. 
CONTEXT (E.G., BUSINESS)
HUMAN
AI
SYSTEM
TASK
GOAL
OUTCOME
Based on: Heinzl et al. 2024

•
The terms “human” and “user” are often used interchangeably
•
This role not only includes people who directly interact with the AI technology (“users”) but 
also those affected by it in some way
•
It also includes those involved in the planning, design and development, implementation and 
introduction, and maintenance of the AI system
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
14
(1) Human
People who interact with or are affected by an AI system when 
performing a task. 
Based on: Heinzl et al. 2024

•
Can refer to single tasks or larger groups of tasks (e.g., business processes)
•
Includes many different types of tasks:
–
Work tasks (e.g., production, procurement, administration, logistics)
–
Design and development tasks (e.g., modelling of business processes, creation of software 
prototypes)
–
Private life tasks (e.g., online shopping, entertainment)
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
15
(2) Task
A set of activities undertaken in order to achieve a specific goal.
Heinzl et al. 2024

(3) AI System
An AI system is a machine-based system that […] infers, from the input 
it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, 
recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual 
environments.

(4) Context
The physical, social, and technical conditions in which a human interacts 
with or is affected by the AI system.

•
A goal is typically expressed in the form of a condition or state
•
In contrast, a task is typically expressed in the form of an activity
•
Example: 
–
Goal: Visit a friend in a small city, 100 km away
–
Task: Rent a car using a car rental website
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
18
(5) Goal
Goals are the targets or accomplishments that a human wants to 
achieve in the near or long term.

•
Large variety of possible outcomes:
–
Instrumental outcomes (e.g., task performance, efficiency, productivity)
–
Psychological outcomes (e.g., satisfaction, happiness, well-being)
–
System outcomes (e.g., performance, errors)
–
…
•
Can be immediate or downstream and intended or unintended
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
19
(6) Outcome
Outcomes are the consequences or results of the interplay between the 
three elements of human, task, and AI system.
Sarker et al. 2019

Your Examples of AI-Based Business 
Information Systems
Please look at the conceptualization of AI-
based business information systems and 
reflect on real-world examples of AI 
systems you are familiar with. What are the 
different elements (user, task, etc.) in your 
examples?
→Discuss this question with a partner for 
~5 minutes and be ready to share one 
example

How are AI-based business information 
systems different from more traditional 
business information systems?

How are AI-based business information systems different?
Berente et al. 2021; Baird & Maruping 2021
Autonomy
“Acting without 
human intervention” 
Learning
“Improving through 
data and experience” 
Inscrutability
“Being unintelligible to 
specific audiences”

•
AI-based business information systems have an increasing 
capacity to act on their own, without human intervention (and 
sometimes even without human knowledge!)
•
Examples:
–
AI-driven credit underwriting software that automatically makes 
credit and loan decisions
–
Robotic process automation (RPA) bots that log into ERP 
systems and automatically execute business processes
–
Robo-advisor platforms that automatically rebalance investments
–
…

23
Autonomy
Berente et al. 2021; Baird & Maruping 2021
Autonomy
“Acting without 
human intervention”

•
Previous generations of business information systems had 
limited ability to automatically improve through data and 
experience
•
AI advances have enabled the learning capacity of AI-based 
business information systems to evolve from basic approaches 
for inductive learning to large-scale approaches (e.g., deep 
learning)
•
Examples:
–
Product recommendation systems that learn from customers’ 
shopping behavior in real time
–
Predictive maintenance software in manufacturing plants that 
learns from previous errors and breakdowns
–
AI-driven recruitment systems that learn from previous successful 
hires
–
… 
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
24
Learning
Berente et al. 2021 
Learning
“Improving through 
data and experience”

•
AI-based business information systems and their outputs often are 
intelligible only to a select audience (e.g., developers, data 
scientists)
•
For others, such as managers or business users, they can be a 
“black box”
•
Examples:
–
AI-based credit and loan decisions that are difficult to understand for 
financial advisors in a bank
–
AI-based sales forecasts that are difficult to understand for sales 
managers 
–
AI-based therapy recommendations that are difficult to understand 
for medical professionals
–
…
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
25
Inscrutability
Berente et al. 2021
Inscrutability
“Being unintelligible to 
specific audiences”

•
Autonomy, learning, and inscrutability are 
interdependent facets that feed into each 
other:
–
Learning contributes to, and results from, 
autonomy
–
Both autonomy and learning result in 
inscrutability
•
The levels of autonomy, learning, and 
inscrutability continue to increase!
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems

Autonomy + Learning + Inscrutability

How (Some) Organizations View AI …

•
AI capabilities have 
developed rapidly, and AI 
technology continues to 
advance at a rapid pace (see 
LLMs)
•
Technology is constantly 
evolving
•
Rather than looking at AI 
through a technological lens, 
it is useful to look at it 
through the lens of business 
capabilities

Business Capabilities
•
Ask: What business needs and objectives can AI support? How and where 
can AI be used to enhance core business activities or enable new ones?
•
Instead of: Which data could we use for machine learning? How can we 
leverage large language models?
Business capabilities refer to the core activities and competencies 
that enable an organization to achieve its business objectives and 
deliver value to its stakeholders. (based on Margherita 2014)

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
There is no single, agreed-upon definition of AI, but one way to 
define AI is to consider the two dimensions of capability 
(thinking vs. acting) and performance (human vs. rational)
•
AI-based (business) information systems are socio-technical 
systems: It is not only about the AI system but also about 
humans, tasks, goals, and outcomes
•
AI-based business information systems are different from more 
traditional business information systems in three facets: 
autonomy, learning, and inscrutability
•
AI-based information systems enable different (and sometimes 
multiple) business capabilities: 
–
Automation, engagement, insights & decisions, innovation
