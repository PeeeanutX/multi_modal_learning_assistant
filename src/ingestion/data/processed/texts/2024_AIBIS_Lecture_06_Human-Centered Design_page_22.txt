The purpose of user needs is to serve as a helpful intermediate step in the transformation of the 
context of use information into user requirements
•
Each component of the context of use (users, goals, tasks, resources, etc.) can be a source for 
user needs
•
User needs are independent of any proposed solution for each need 
–
→A user need must not refer to, for example, “the system” or “the website”
