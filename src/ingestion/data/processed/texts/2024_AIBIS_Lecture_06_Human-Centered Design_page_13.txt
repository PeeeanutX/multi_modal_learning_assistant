The context of use has the following 
components: 
– Users (people who interact with the system)
– Goals (what users want to achieve) 
– Tasks (what users do to achieve their goals) 
– Context (in which the interaction takes place)
– Resources (the means required to perform the 
task)

A context-of-use description can be a description 
of the current context of use, or a description of 
the context intended for design
