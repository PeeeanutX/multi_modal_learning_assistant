Previous generations of business information systems had 
limited ability to automatically improve through data and 
experience
•
AI advances have enabled the learning capacity of AI-based 
business information systems to evolve from basic approaches 
for inductive learning to large-scale approaches (e.g., deep

–
AI-driven recruitment systems that learn from previous successful 
hires
