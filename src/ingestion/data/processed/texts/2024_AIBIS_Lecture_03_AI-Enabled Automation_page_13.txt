More than 20,000 items make up the average 
assortment of a drugstore in Germany
•
Keeping track of how much of which product is 
still in stock and whether everything is in the 
right place is a huge task

DM uses innovative scanning robots from the 
German start-up Ubica Robotics to check

data and recognize which shelves need to be 
restocked, which items need to be reordered 
and which products need to be returned to 
their destination
