RECAP: Business Capabilities
•
AI-enabled business capabilities include:
– Automation
– Engagement 
– Insights & decisions
– Innovation
Business capabilities refer to the core activities and competencies 
that enable an organization to achieve its business objectives and 
deliver value to its stakeholders. (based on Margherita 2014)

AI-Enabled Automation
AI-enabled automation refers to the use of AI to perform tasks 
and processes that traditionally required human involvement. 
Physical automation
Cognitive automation

•
Physical automation is as old as the first industrial 
revolution (see spinning machine)
•
Today, industrial robots can be found in many factories 
and warehouses (“blue collar work”)
•
While still emerging in Western countries, service robots 
are common in Asia
•
Robots’ physical activity causes visible changes in their 
physical environment

Physical Automation
Physical automation focuses on the use of machines (e.g., 
robots) that execute tasks in the physical world.

More than 20,000 items make up the average 
assortment of a drugstore in Germany
•
Keeping track of how much of which product is 
still in stock and whether everything is in the 
right place is a huge task
•
DM uses innovative scanning robots from the 
German start-up Ubica Robotics to check 
inventory levels at night
•

restocked, which items need to be reordered 
and which products need to be returned to

Cognitive automation typically targets knowledge and service work tasks (“white collar 
work”), for which automation seemed unimaginable a decade ago
•
Software robots (“bots”) are computer programs and have no physical form at all
•
The activity of software robots may not be visible to humans

•
RPA bots essentially mimic human behavior by logging in with an account and password, 
entering data, clicking buttons, etc.
•
Typically, RPA bots are designed to interact with existing IT systems (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, 
SAP ERP) and perform routine tasks in a rule-based manner, such as copying and pasting data 
from one system to another
•
Though RPA is less “intelligent” than other AI technologies, it is usually considered part of AI, 
especially as RPA vendors are adding more intelligence to their software (e.g., integrating 
computer vision and machine learning capabilities)

Robotic Process Automation
Robotic process automation (RPA) enables digital processes to 
be automated through software robots (“bots”) that operate on 
the user interface in the same way as humans do.
Willcocks et al. 2016; Schulte-Derne & Gnewuch 2024

[PAGE 18]

•
RPA bots are ideally suited to replace 
humans for so-called “swivel chair” 
processes
•
Processes where humans take inputs 
from one set of systems (for example 
email), process those inputs using rules, 
and then enter the outputs into systems 
of record (e.g., ERP systems)

Affective Responses to Software Robots 
Waizenegger & Techatassanasoontorn 2022
“Especially the fear of the robots, all 
of those movies that we've seen 
where the robots take over... so 
they're like I'm going to lose my job 
over this, you know? It's always that 
fear.”
Fear
“The team were delighted with this 
process right, because they don't want 
to sit around doing these transactions 
anyways... [...] So having such a 
repetitive manual task taken away from 
you they thought was really cool, 'cause 
then they can get on and do much more 
human add value work”

Cognitive Responses to Software Robots 
Waizenegger & Techatassanasoontorn 2022; Techatassanasoontorn et al. 2023;
Security Concerns
“They do not fully trust the robots 
because robots do not get it right 
every time. It’s assisting us to some 
degree… But what I’m saying is we 
can’t rely on the robot for any 
overdraft account that he’s giving us 
the full picture.”
(Mis)trust
“We don’t want the robot to be a 
superuser as an individual bot can 
do random stuff to the database, 
which is quite risky”

Behavioral Responses to Software Robots 
Resistance
"People talk about the robot as if it’s 
like a person. They go, ‘The robot –
it’s kicking out a lot of exceptions 
today’. And I know one of the other 
teams calls it [the bot] Robby … 
Their nickname for it is Robby and 
they’re like, ‘Robby’s having a few 
troubles this morning'"
Anthropomorphism
(“Humanizing”)
“Once you bring in automation, that’s 
when they are like, I don’t 
understand this. I don’t like this. I’m 
going to go back to doing it myself.”

Skill erosion refers to the process of losing 
skills and knowledge needed to perform a 
job/task when automation takes over
•
Examples:
–
Financial advisors are no longer able to analyze 
loan applications and make loan decisions 
independently
–
AI writing assistance leads to a decline in writing 
skills
–
Generative AI leads to an erosion of human 
creativity (e.g., ChatGPT writes poems or essays)

why not?

RECAP: Automation vs. Augmentation
Raisch & Krakowski 2021; Rai et al. 2019
Automation: Humans hand over a task 
to AI with little or no further involvement.
Augmentation: Humans collaborate 
closely with AI to perform a task.
Reduce costs and free up staff 
for more value-added work
Leverage complementary strengths 
and enable mutual learning

Automation and augmentation are interdependent!
1. Across time: Augmentation of a task can allow 
subsequent automation (see example from self-study 
material)
2. Across space: Automation in one task can “spill over,” 
enabling adjacent tasks’ automation or augmentation

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
Humans have long been at risk of unemployment 
brought by new technologies (not just AI)
•
There are two main types of AI-enabled automation: 
physical and cognitive automation
•
AI-enabled automation advances from mechanical to 
analytical, intuitive, and empathetic tasks
•
There is a wide range of affective, cognitive, and 
behavioral responses (both positive and negative) from 
humans toward AI-enabled automation
•
AI-enabled automation creates benefits but also poses 
risks (e.g., skill erosion)
•
Augmentation (e.g., human-in-the-loop) is often 
described as an alternative to automation, but the two 
approaches are not independent from each other
