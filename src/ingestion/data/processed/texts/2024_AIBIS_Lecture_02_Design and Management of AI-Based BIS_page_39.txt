Case study of a German bank (“Main 
Finance”)
•
Main Finance implemented an AI-
based system (“CleverLoan”) to 
substitute for human decision making 
in the loan consultation process
•
Before the introduction of CleverLoan, 
the bank’s loan consultants were 
responsible for advising customers 
and deciding whether to grant a loans
•
Afterwards, CleverLoan autonomously 
decided whether to approve a loan 
and provided the consultant with a 
final and irreversible decision
