Human-Centered Design – ISO Standard
https://www.iso.org/standard/77520.html

•
A human-centered design approach should 
follow these principles:
1. the design is based upon an explicit 
understanding of users, tasks and environments
2. Users are involved throughout design and 
development
3. the design is driven and refined by user-centered 
evaluation
4. the process is iterative
5. the design addresses the whole user experience
6. the design team includes multidisciplinary skills 
and perspectives

•
The context of use has the following 
components: 
– Users (people who interact with the system)
– Goals (what users want to achieve) 
– Tasks (what users do to achieve their goals) 
– Context (in which the interaction takes place)
– Resources (the means required to perform the 
task)
•
A context-of-use description can be a description 
of the current context of use, or a description of 
the context intended for design
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
14
Context of Use
UXQB 2022

Teenagers waiting for a bus use their smartphones 
to send funny videos to their friends, hoping to 
make them laugh.
–
Users: Teenagers
–
Goal: Make friends laugh
–
Task: Send videos

Key Deliverables
Personas
As-Is Scenarios
Who are the users? What 
are their goals?
User Journey Maps
How do users interact with 
the (new) system and the 
organization providing it?
How do users currently do 
tasks? In which contexts? What 
resources are available?

•
Personas are not real people; they are realistic representations of users, constructed for 
example from observations or interviews
•
Personas are usually captured in a document or presentation, providing an easily digestible 
visualization of the target user(s)
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
18
Personas
A description of a fictitious but realistic user and what they intend 
to do when using a system.
UXQB 2022

•
Typically, a persona includes:
•
The persona’s name
•
An image (e.g., a photo)
•
Demographic information such 
as age, gender, family/living 
situation, employment status, …
•
Their needs and goals in relation 
to the current or future system
•
A summary of their challenges, 
frustrations and pain points in 
relation to the current or future 
system
•
Quotes from real users whom 
the persona should represent
•

Components of Personas & Example
https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/what-are-ux-personas/

Example:
“John Doe is an IT consultant who frequently shops for groceries 
online due to his busy schedule. He prefers to use the same grocery 
delivery service because it allows him to quickly reorder items from 
his past purchases. However, every so often, he forgets to check the 
delivery time slots. This often results in frustration when he realizes 
his preferred delivery window is already fully booked, causing him to 
wait much longer for groceries to arrive than expected.”

As-Is Scenario
An as-is scenario is a narrative text description of the procedure 
a specific user currently follows to complete one or more tasks.

How to Derive User Requirements?
Context of Use
User Needs
User Requirements
Personas, as-is scenarios, 
user journey maps, etc. from 
the context-of-use analysis
User needs are identified 
based on the results of the 
analysis phase
User requirements are derived 
from the identified user needs
…
…
Analysis
Specification
ISO 9241-210

•
The purpose of user needs is to serve as a helpful intermediate step in the transformation of the 
context of use information into user requirements
•
Each component of the context of use (users, goals, tasks, resources, etc.) can be a source for 
user needs
•
User needs are independent of any proposed solution for each need 
–
→A user need must not refer to, for example, “the system” or “the website”
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
23
User Need
A prerequisite identified as necessary for a user, or a user group, to 
achieve a goal, implied or stated within a specific context of use.
UXQB 2023

Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
24
Example: Identifying User Needs in Context of Use Information 
Context of Use
Identified User Needs
Patients often have to wait for treatment 
beyond the agreed time of their appointment. 
Being forced to wait is very annoying for 
patients, especially when they have to sit in the 
waiting room for up to 90 minutes without any 
clear indication of how long it will be until it is 
their turn.
The patient needs to know when their 
scheduled appointment will in fact begin 
before arriving at the doctor’s office in order to
make good use of the time remaining.
Patients often make appointments well in 
advance, because good doctors are not 
available at short notice.
The patient needs to have an appointment to 
ensure they receive treatment at the agreed 
time.
UXQB 2023

•
User requirements are precise criteria from the users’ point of view that must be met by the 
system before its release
•
User requirements are derived from user needs
–
For simple systems, user requirements can be derived directly from the context of use description 
without first identifying and documenting user needs
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
25
User Requirement
A requirement for use that provides the basis for design and 
evaluation of a system to meet user needs.
UXQB 2022

•
Qualitative user requirements address the way in which the system is 
used to arrive at a user goal
•
Quantitative user requirements set measurable quality objectives
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
26
Qualitative vs. Quantitative User Requirements
Quantitative: A required level of usability to meet identified user needs expressed in 
terms of measures of effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, accessibility, user 
experience and avoidance of harm from use in a specified context of use.
Qualitative: A statement of what users must be able to locate, recognize, understand, 
select or input as part of conducting a task with the system to meet identified user needs 
in a specified context of use.
UXQB 2022

Qualitative User Requirements
Syntax rule:
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize / select / input / … <information or 
resource> under <optional condition>.
Example “Shopping Website”:
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize which products are in his/her 
shopping basket (information), before starting 
the payment process (condition).
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
27
Formulating User Requirements
Quantitative User Requirements
Quantitative user requirements can be formulated by 
taking the following components into consideration: 
•
The user group(s) who must fulfil the requirement 
during use 
•
The number or percentage of users who must 
fulfil the requirement during use 
•
The units of measurement (e.g., task time, error 
rate, precision)
Example “Shopping Website”:
After completing their shopping process, 80% of users 
must answer ‘Agree’ or ‘Strongly agree’ to the 
statement ‘The shopping website is easy to use’. 
(satisfaction)

Example: Deriving User Requirements from User Needs
Identified User Needs 
Derived User Requirements
The patient needs to know when their 
scheduled appointment will in fact begin 
before arriving at the doctor’s office in order 
to make good use of the time remaining.
•
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize that a scheduled appointment will 
be delayed.
•
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize for how long the scheduled 
appointment will be delayed.
The patient needs to have an 
appointment to ensure they receive 
treatment at the agreed time.
•
With the system, the user must be able to 
recognize which dates and times are available 
for appointments.
•
With the system, the user must be able to select 
a date and time for the appointment.

Use Scenario
UXQB 2022
Example:
“Before starting his busy workday, John Doe logs into the grocery 
delivery website. After selecting his usual items from his previous 
orders with a single click, he is prompted to reserve a delivery slot. 
He sees that his preferred delivery slot is still available and books it 
right away. John can now focus on his work, knowing that his 
groceries will arrive when it’s most convenient for him.”
A narrative text description of how a user will carry out one or 
more tasks with the planned system.

•
A low-fidelity prototype is often created using paper, pens, 
sticky notes, etc.
•
Digital prototypes are often created with a prototyping tool
•
Low fidelity prototypes should be quick and cost-effective 
to create and update
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
32
Low-Fidelity Prototype
UXQB 2022
A low-cost illustration of a design or concept used to gather 
feedback from users and other stakeholders during the early 
stages of design.

Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
33
Low-Fidelity Prototype: Example
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yafaGNFu8Eg

•
The purpose of wireframes is to define a skeletal layout that is easy to understand, and 
encourages iteration and feedback
•
Wireframes typically do not address visual design (e.g., colors) and precise layout
•
Wireframes can be created using pen and paper or with tools such as Balsamiq
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
34
Wireframe
UXQB 2022
A screen or page in a low-fidelity prototype for a user interface 
comprised of lines, rectangular boxes and text that represent the 
intended interaction design.

Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
35
Wireframe: Examples

Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
36
High-Fidelity Prototype
•
High-fidelity prototypes are computer-based, and usually allow realistic (mouse/keyboard) user 
interactions
–
Created using tools like Figma
•
High-fidelity prototypes take you as close as possible to a true representation of the user interface
•
After a successful evaluation, the high-fidelity prototype informs the development of the system
UXQB 2022
A prototype that mirrors the user interface of a system as closely 
as possible, often displaying pixel-perfect user interface 
elements and visual design.

Basic steps:
1.
Create a usability test guide
2.
Recruit test participants (e.g., potential users)
3.
Conduct several test sessions (e.g., think aloud sessions, post-session interviews)
4.
Analyze feedback and create usability test report
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
41
Usability Test
A usability evaluation that involves representative users 
performing specific tasks with the system to enable identification 
and analysis of usability problems, or the measurement of 
effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction.
UXQB 2022

•
The guide should include:
–
Goal(s) of the usability test
–
Number of planned usability test participants and their characteristics
–
Usability test tasks
–
Approximate length of each usability test session
–
Procedure of the session
–
Pre- and post-test questions

•
A usability test report typically contains:
–
an executive summary
–
all usability findings (including positive usability findings), meaningfully grouped
–
screenshots or pictures that supplement the description of important usability findings
–
characteristics of the test users, including selection criteria for recruiting
–
the usability test guide
•
A usability test report is always required! If you have limited resources, produce a basic usability 
test report: 
–
This may consist of 3-5 pages or slides, which include an executive summary, the key findings and the 
list of usability test tasks

User Survey
A usability evaluation where users are asked to complete a 
questionnaire about their experience of using a system.
UXQB 2022; Brooke 1996
•
Questionnaire: a set of questions that is used to 
collect data from users
–
Open questions: Where did you encounter problems?
–
Closed questions: On a scale from 1 to 5, please rate 
how satisfied you are with the system
•
A significant number of responses (100+) is required 
for them to be statistically reliable
Example “System Usability Scale” (SUS)

•
Usability inspection is often performed by UX professionals or subject matter experts, who 
base their judgement on prior experience of usability problems encountered by users and their 
own knowledge of design guidelines and principles
•
Unlike usability tests and user surveys, usability inspections do not involve users
•
Why? Evaluation by users is not always possible or cost-effective at every stage of the project
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
46
Usability Inspection
A usability evaluation based on the judgment of one or more 
evaluators who examine or use a system to identify potential 
usability problems and deviations from user requirements.
UXQB 2022

Key Takeaways
•
It is important to involve humans in the design of AI-
based information systems
•
A human-centered design approach consists four key 
activities that are performed iteratively:
–
Analyze
–
Specify
–
Design
–
Evaluate
•
For each activity, there are different methods, tools, and 
techniques, which result in key deliverables for the next 
activity
