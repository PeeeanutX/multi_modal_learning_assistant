•
Ethics has been a key concern in philosophy since antiquity and in many philosophical systems it 
has been the key question
•
Ethics theories come in three groups:
–
Virtue ethics →what would a person of good character do?
–
Deontological (or duty) ethics →rules, principles, and duties
–
Consequentialist (or results-based) ethics→what will the outcomes of the action be?

Ethics
Ethics is the philosophical discipline interested in questions of
right and wrong, good and bad, do’s or don’ts.
Hassan et al. 2018; Nussbaum 2009

The Three Laws of Robotics were formulated by science-
fiction writer Isaac Asimov and first appeared in his short 
story “Runaround” in 1942
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, 
allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except 
where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such 
protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. 
•
The laws have pervaded science fiction and have also 
influenced thought on the ethics of AI

•
The central concern of AI ethics is to identify how AI can 
advance or raise concerns to the good life of 
individuals, whether in terms of quality of life, or human 
autonomy and freedom necessary for a democratic society
•
AI ethics has been mostly conceptual, with a significant 
emphasis on defining the principles for ethical AI
AI ethics is a multidisciplinary field that addresses the ethical 
issues raised by the development, deployment, and use of AI.

Two Approaches to AI Ethics
The EU asserts its regulatory 
power to protect fundamental 
rights, democracy, the rule of 
law, and environmental 
sustainability from high-risk AI
→Top-down legislative 
regulation (“hard laws”): 
e.g., EU AI Act
China’s AI regulation has 
authoritarian characteristics: 
Supporting AI development 
without undermining 
censorship and jeopardizing 
the Communist Party’s 
monopoly on political power
The United States relies on 
voluntary guidance and self-
regulation by tech companies
→Bottom-up “soft laws” 
without legally binding 
force: e.g., principles for 
ethical AI

Difficult Negotiations on Foundation Models
https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eus-ai-act-negotiations-hit-the-brakes-over-foundation-models/
“France, Germany, and Italy pushed against any type of regulation for foundation models. Leading the charge 
against any regulation for foundation models in the AI rulebook is Mistral, a French AI start-up that has thrown the gauntlet 
to Big Tech. Cedric O, France’s former state secretary for digital, is pushing Mistral's lobbying efforts, arguing that the AI 
Act could kill the company. Meanwhile, Germany is being pressured by its own leading AI company Aleph Alpha [..]. All 
these companies fear the EU regulation might put them on a back foot compared to US and Chinese competitors.”

Jobin et al. (2019) conducted a systematic meta-
analysis of 84 AI ethics documents published by 
government agencies (e.g., the European Union, 
OECD), private companies (e.g., Microsoft, SAP), and 
research institutions (e.g., ACM, IEEE) from different 
geographic regions
•
The principles of responsibility, justice and fairness, 
transparency, non-maleficence, and privacy were 
referenced in more than half of all documents, 
indicating an emerging global convergence across 
stakeholders on the importance of these five principles

Transparency
•
Possible scenarios:
–
Explaining the features of a machine learning model that led to a specific prediction (→see XAI lecture)
–
Telling customers that they are interacting with a chatbot and not with a human service employee
–
Disclosing how content was generated/improved using ChatGPT (e.g., parts of your master thesis)
–
…
AI actors “should provide meaningful information, appropriate to the context [...] 
to foster a general understanding of AI systems, to make stakeholders aware of 
their interactions with AI systems [...] to enable those affected by an AI system 
to understand the outcome, and, to enable those adversely affected by an AI 
system to challenge its outcome [...]”

Justice & Fairness
•
“Fair AI”
•
Possible scenarios:
–
Making sure that there are no gender or racial biases in job application decisions made by AI
–
Allowing customers to challenge (unfair) loan or credit decisions made by AI
–
…
The development, deployment and use of AI systems must be fair. […] fairness has 
both a substantive and a procedural dimension. The substantive dimension implies a 
commitment to: ensuring equal and just distribution of both benefits and costs, and 
ensuring that individuals and groups are free from unfair bias, discrimination and 
stigmatization. […] The procedural dimension of fairness entails the ability to contest 
and seek effective redress against decisions made by AI systems and by the humans 
operating them. […]

Non-Maleficence
•
Possible scenarios:
–
Protecting democracy from AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation
–
Reducing the significant energy consumption of generative AI training processes
–
…
“AI systems should not be used in ways that cause or exacerbate harm, whether 
individual or collective, and including harm to social, cultural, economic, natural, 
and political environments.”

Responsibility
•
“Responsible AI”
•
Possible scenarios:
–
Putting the responsibility on doctors to verify the suggestions of an AI-based diagnosis tool before applying them to a patient
–
Holding car manufacturers, software developers, and operators accountable when an autonomous vehicle is involved in an 
accident
–
…
“[…] The ethical responsibility and liability for the decisions and actions based 
in any way on an AI system should always ultimately be attributable to AI actors 
corresponding to their role in the life cycle of the AI system. Appropriate 
oversight, impact assessment, audit, and due diligence mechanisms […] should 
be developed to ensure accountability for AI systems and their impact 
throughout their life cycle.”

scraped from the web to train AI 
models
–
Making sure that AI systems do not 
leak sensitive user or company data

•
Over a period of two and a half years, 45 robotic process 
automation (RPA) bots were implemented to automate 
many back-office processes (e.g., customer service, 
billing)

These RPA bots enabled the automated processing of 
more than 200,000 back-office transactions per year →
equivalent to 5 full-time employees

Recommendations for Translating Ethical AI Principles into Practice
Schulte-Derne & Gnewuch 2024
1)
Define and assign roles for selecting, implementing, 
supervising, and optimizing AI-automated processes
2)
Avoid delegating the overall responsibility for (negative) 
consequences to those developing or implementing AI
Responsibility
Justice & 
Fairness
Privacy
Non-
Maleficence
Transparency
AI Ethics Principles
3)
Strive for a fair distribution of AI’s 
benefits and costs among all employees
4)
Understand and address personal 
tensions in a diverse workforce with 
different socio-demographic 
backgrounds and levels of technical 
expertise
5)
Enable open and honest communication from 
trusted peers to allow employees to discuss their 
concerns and ask questions without feeling judged
6)
Make the invisible visible by providing employees 
the opportunity to observe the AI at work
7)
Keep employee representation bodies in the loop
8)
Help employees find strategies to cope with their 
fears
9)
Avoid overwhelming employees by taking away 
all their routine tasks before they have the 
opportunity to develop confidence in their new 
responsibilities
10) Examine who else besides the organization’s 
employees is impacted by the AI implementation
11) Involve data protection officers 
before investing time and effort in 
a new AI initiative

[PAGE 41]
Logo of the University of Passau
Strategy #6: Make the invisible visible 
by providing employees the opportunity 
to observe the AI at work
•
The RPA team set up the RPA software 
on a normal desktop PC placed in one 
of the offices and invited employees and 
works council members to observe its 
functioning at any time
•
This not only reduced employees’ 
uncertainty and works council members’ 
concerns, but also turned fear into 
curiosity

Legislative vs. Principled Approach 
to AI Ethics
In your opinion, which approach to AI ethics 
is better? Should governments formally 
regulate AI? Should we trust companies to 
follow their ethics principles?
→Discuss these questions with a partner for 
~5 minutes and be ready to share your 
opinions

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
The development, deployment, and use of AI raise many 
ethical concerns, such as job displacement, bias, lack of 
control, and privacy issues
•
The field of AI ethics aims to address these concerns by 
exploring and guiding what is morally right or wrong
•
There are two main approaches to AI ethics
•
1) The legislative approach focusing on top-down regulation
–
Example: EU AI Act
•
2) The principled approach focusing on bottom-up “soft laws” 
–
Example: Ethical AI principles such as transparency, justice and 
fairness, and responsibility 
•
Both approaches have their benefits and challenges:
–
Regulation may impose inflexible requirements and hinder 
innovation
–
Principles are non-binding and difficult to put into practice
