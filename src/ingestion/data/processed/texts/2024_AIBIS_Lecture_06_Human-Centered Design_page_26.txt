Formulating User Requirements
Quantitative User Requirements
Quantitative user requirements can be formulated by 
taking the following components into consideration: 
•
The user group(s) who must fulfil the requirement 
during use 
•
The number or percentage of users who must 
fulfil the requirement during use 
•
The units of measurement (e.g., task time, error 
rate, precision)
Example “Shopping Website”:
After completing their shopping process, 80% of users 
must answer ‘Agree’ or ‘Strongly agree’ to the 
statement ‘The shopping website is easy to use’.
