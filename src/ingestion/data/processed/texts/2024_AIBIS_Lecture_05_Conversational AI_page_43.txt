•
Large language models such as GPT-4 can be used to operate a Furhat robot and hold highly 
human-like sales conversations with consumers about Bluetooth speakers
–
Some challenges remain (e.g., delays, speech recognition failures) but overall, very stable
•
Our LLM-based Furhat robot was able to create perceptions of an “emotional” or “rational” robot 
design through different natural language interaction
•
The results of our experiment with ~100 student participants show that an emotional robot design 
has negative impacts on consumers:
–
Reduces purchase likelihood (consumers are less likely to purchase the Bluetooth speaker 
recommended by Furhat)
–
Reduces recommendation adherence (consumers are less likely to follow the recommendation 
suggested by Furhat)
•
Future research: What drives the negative impact of emotional robot design?
