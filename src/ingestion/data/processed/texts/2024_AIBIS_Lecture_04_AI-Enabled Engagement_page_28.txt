“Most AI voice assistants are gendered as young women, and are mostly 
used to answer questions or carry out tasks like checking the weather, 
playing music, or setting reminders. This sends a signal that women are 
docile, eager-to-please helpers without any agency, always on hand to help 
their masters, helping to reinforce harmful stereotypes.”
