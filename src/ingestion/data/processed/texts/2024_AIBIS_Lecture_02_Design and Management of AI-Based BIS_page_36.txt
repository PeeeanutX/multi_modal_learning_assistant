Case study at a German-based energy service provider
•
In 2019, the CEO decided to implement robotic process 
automation (RPA) to automate back-office processes 
(e.g., in customer service, billing)
•
Over a period of two and a half years, 45 RPA bots 
were implemented to enable the automated processing 
of more than 200,000 back-office transactions per year 
→equivalent to 5 full-time employees
•
Employees were concerned about RPA’s impact on 
their jobs
