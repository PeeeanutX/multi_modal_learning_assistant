Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
Humans have long been at risk of unemployment 
brought by new technologies (not just AI)
•
There are two main types of AI-enabled automation: 
physical and cognitive automation

AI-enabled automation advances from mechanical to 
analytical, intuitive, and empathetic tasks
•
There is a wide range of affective, cognitive, and 
behavioral responses (both positive and negative) from 
humans toward AI-enabled automation
•
AI-enabled automation creates benefits but also poses 
risks (e.g., skill erosion)

Augmentation (e.g., human-in-the-loop) is often 
described as an alternative to automation, but the two
