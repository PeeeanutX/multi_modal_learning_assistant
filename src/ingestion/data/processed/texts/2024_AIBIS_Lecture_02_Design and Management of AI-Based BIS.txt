What Do We Mean by “Design”?
Design, used as a verb, refers to the 
act of planning or creating something 
for a specific purpose 
→“design process”
Design, used as a noun, refers to the 
outcome of the design process
→“design product”
Baskerville et al. 2015

[PAGE 8]
Logo of the University of Passau
•
There are many process models or frameworks that offer step-by-step guidance on how to 
design a (business) information system
•
These models typically involve a set of activities:
–
Analyzing the status quo and collecting requirements
–
Evaluating (design) alternatives
–
Developing the system (or procuring it) 
–
Implementation, operation, and maintenance
–
…
•
The design process is not linear but iterative!

The systems development life 
cycle (SDLC) is one of the most 
widely applied methods for 
designing business information 
systems
•
It includes four key steps:
– Planning and selection
– Analysis
– Design
– Implementation and operation

Step
Description
1. Design, data 
and modelling
•
Planning and design involves articulating the system’s concept and objectives, 
underlying assumptions, context and requirements, and potentially building a 
prototype.
•
Data collection and processing includes gathering and cleaning data, performing 
checks for completeness and quality, and documenting the dataset. 
•
Model building and interpretation involves the creation or selection of models or 
algorithms, their calibration and/or training and interpretation.
2. Verification 
and validation
… involves executing and tuning models, with tests to assess performance across various 
dimensions and considerations. 
3. Deployment
… involves piloting, checking compatibility with legacy systems, ensuring regulatory 
compliance, managing organizational change and evaluating user experience. 
4. Operation 
and monitoring
… involves operating the AI system and continuously assessing its recommendations and 
impacts (both intended and unintended) in light of objectives and ethical considerations.

•
Similar high-level sequence of process steps:
– Planning/analysis
– Design
– Implementation
– Operation
•
Key differences:
– Centrality of data and models that rely on data
– Focus on experimentation →many iterations at every step
– Focus on continuous improvement, even after the deployment, due to AI’s capacity to 
optimize and evolve over time

Design as a Product
Design, used as a noun, refers to the outcome of the design 
process (“product”).
•
There is a large body of knowledge about a “good” or “ideal” design of (business) information 
systems
•
This design knowledge is captured in different forms:
–
Standards
–
Guidelines
–
Design principles
•
AI-specific design knowledge exists, but it is important to not forget about general design 
knowledge that applies to all (business) information systems

Design Principles for Ethical AI
Principle
Example Definition
Transparency
AI actors “should provide meaningful information, appropriate to the context [...] to foster a general understanding of AI 
systems, to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems [...] to enable those affected by an AI system 
to understand the outcome, and, to enable those adversely affected by an AI system to challenge its outcome [...]” 
(OECD)
Justice and 
fairness
The development, deployment and use of AI systems must be fair. […] fairness has both a substantive and a procedural 
dimension. The substantive dimension implies a commitment to: ensuring equal and just distribution of both benefits and 
costs, and ensuring that individuals and groups are free from unfair bias, discrimination and stigmatization. […] The 
procedural dimension of fairness entails the ability to contest and seek effective redress against decisions made by AI 
systems and by the humans operating them. […] (EU)
Non-maleficence
AI systems should not be used in ways that cause or exacerbate harm, whether individual or collective, and including 
harm to social, cultural, economic, natural, and political environments. (United Nations)
Responsibility
Designers and builders of advanced AI systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and 
actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications. (Future of Life Institute) 
Privacy
Artificial intelligence should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families, or communities.

Research Example: Transparency in AI-Based Customer Service
Gnewuch et al. (2023): https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2022.0152
vs.
Human involvement not disclosed
Human involvement disclosed
Should companies that use hybrid service agents (chatbot + human employees working behind the scenes) be 
transparent about human involvement? 
•
The disclosure of human involvement changed customer communication behavior 
•
This ultimately increased employee workload because fewer customer requests could be handled 
automatically by the chatbot and had to delegated to a human

[PAGE 26]
Logo of the University of Passau
Transparency in AI-Based Customer Service
Please imagine that you are responsible for 
designing a hybrid service agent (chatbot + human 
employees). Given that disclosing human 
involvement can lead to increased effort from 
employees (and potentially raise your operational 
costs), would you still choose to be transparent 
with your customers? Why?
→Discuss these questions with a partner for ~5 
minutes and be ready to share your opinions

Challenges When Managing AI
Hopf et al. 2023
Challenge
Expectations / Assumptions / Demands
Reality
Inflated
expectations
• Expectation that AI technology can revolutionize 
everything overnight
• Tendency to throw AI at every problem
• Unrealistic expectations can easily lead to 
disappointments about the return-on-investment of AI 
initiatives
• AI comes with errors and limitations, like any other IT
Managing AI 
projects
like IT projects
• Assumption that ML models are just computer 
programs that are easy to create and modify
• Expectation that a continuous delivery of results 
is possible
• AI applications are learning agents, not 
deterministically programmed systems
• Even established software development approaches 
cannot fully account for the exploratory and 
collaborative nature of AI projects
The question of 
why
• Decision makers demand explanations and 
prescriptions in high-stakes and uncertain 
situations
• Legal and ethical requirements demand 
interpretability
• ML models are black boxes and based on 
correlations only, but they are typically more accurate 
than traditional methods of prediction
Dynamic 
environments
• Traditional software, once put into production, 
runs over years
• Predictive accuracy of ML models degrades over time
• Frequent updates and retraining of models is 
necessary

Key Questions at the Strategic Level
What is the potential impact of AI on our 
business model, culture, strategy, and 
industry? 
How can we use AI to reduce costs? How 
can AI help us automate processes?
Do we need an AI / data 
strategy? Who can help 
us develop one?
Should we replace our employees 
with AI (now or in the future)?
Which AI technology 
and AI providers 
should we choose?
How can we prepare our workforce for 
AI? How and where can we find and 
hire top AI talent?

•
IT has always been used to automate work, but the growing capabilities of AI may allow 
automation on a much larger scale
•
Still, not all tasks can be (fully) automated
•
Key strategic decision between automation and augmentation:
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
34
Automation vs. Augmentation
Raisch & Krakowski 2021; Rai et al. 2019
Automation: Humans hand over a task 
to AI with little or no further involvement.
Augmentation: Humans collaborate 
closely with AI to perform a task.
Reduce costs and free up staff 
for more value-added work
Leverage complementary strengths 
and enable mutual learning

[PAGE 34]
Logo of the University of Passau
•
The relationship between automation and 
augmentation is not a trade-off decision
•
Augmentation can also be a driver of automation
•
Example of candidate assessment process at JP 
Morgan Chase:
–
Initial augmentation stage: A team of experienced 
HR managers worked closely with an AI-based 
system to identify reliable, firm-specific predictors of 
candidates’ future job performance. 
–
After a year of intensive interaction between the 
human experts and the AI-based system, JP Morgan 
Chase decided to automate the candidate 
assessment process because the system was now 
reliable enough

But: Augmentation Can Lead to Automation
Riley 2018; Raisch & Krakowski 2021

[PAGE 35]
Logo of the University of Passau
•
While some organizations immediately release 
human employees, many try to avoid layoffs
•
Upskilling and reskilling are two strategies that can 
help organizations adapt to the changes caused by 
AI automation
–
Upskilling is about learning new skills to be better at 
the current job role
–
Reskilling is about learning new skills to move into a 
different job role
•
These strategies also allow organizations to develop 
talent that is not readily available in the market and 
fill existing skill gaps

Key Questions at the Tactical Level
How can I manage the 
change and disruption 
associated with our new AI 
initiative?
How can I implement our new AI 
system in a responsible way?
What does our new AI initiative mean 
for the future of my department or 
business unit? 
How to communicate our new AI 
initiative without causing fear and 
uncertainty among employees?
How can I use AI myself 
to manage my department 
or teams?
How will my department or my 
teams react when they hear about 
the new AI system?

automation (RPA) to automate back-office processes 
(e.g., in customer service, billing)
•
Over a period of two and a half years, 45 RPA bots 
were implemented to enable the automated processing 
of more than 200,000 back-office transactions per year 
→equivalent to 5 full-time employees

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
Designing and managing AI is different from designing and 
managing more traditional business information systems
•
Many process models exist that offer guidance on how to 
design AI-based business information systems (e.g., OECD’s AI 
system lifecycle, CRISP-DM)
•
There are many design principles and guidelines for (AI-based) 
information systems, some of which specifically address AI-
related design challenges (e.g., ethical concerns)
•
The management of AI presents challenges to organizations at 
every level:
–
Strategic level (e.g., impact of AI on business strategy and 
workforce)
–
Tactical level (e.g., introduction of new AI-based systems)
–
Operational level (e.g., employees’ perception of and interaction 
with a newly introduced AI-based system)
•
There are common strategies and tactics for addressing these 
challenges (e.g., upskilling and reskilling programs)
