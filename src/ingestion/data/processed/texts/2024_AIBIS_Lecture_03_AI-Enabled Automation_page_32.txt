Behavioral Responses to Software Robots 
Resistance
"People talk about the robot as if it’s 
like a person. They go, ‘The robot –
it’s kicking out a lot of exceptions 
today’. And I know one of the other 
teams calls it [the bot] Robby … 
Their nickname for it is Robby and 
they’re like, ‘Robby’s having a few 
troubles this morning'"
Anthropomorphism
“Once you bring in automation, that’s 
when they are like, I don’t 
understand this. I don’t like this. I’m 
going to go back to doing it myself.”
