Automated self-checkout 
cashiers and self-order kiosks 
have become omnipresent in our 
everyday lives
– Very convenient, especially for 
low involvement products (e.g., 
groceries)
•
However, in case of high 
involvement products (e.g., smart 
phones), consumers typically 
prefer to speak with and get 
advice from a human employee
