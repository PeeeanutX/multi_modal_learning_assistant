Challenges When Managing AI
Hopf et al. 2023
Challenge
Expectations / Assumptions / Demands
Reality
Inflated
expectations
• Expectation that AI technology can revolutionize 
everything overnight
• Tendency to throw AI at every problem
• Unrealistic expectations can easily lead to 
disappointments about the return-on-investment of AI 
initiatives
• AI comes with errors and limitations, like any other IT
Managing AI 
projects
like IT projects
• Assumption that ML models are just computer 
programs that are easy to create and modify
• Expectation that a continuous delivery of results 
is possible
• AI applications are learning agents, not 
deterministically programmed systems
• Even established software development approaches 
cannot fully account for the exploratory and 
collaborative nature of AI projects
The question of 
why
• Decision makers demand explanations and 
prescriptions in high-stakes and uncertain 
situations
• Legal and ethical requirements demand 
interpretability
• ML models are black boxes and based on 
correlations only, but they are typically more accurate 
than traditional methods of prediction
Dynamic 
environments
• Traditional software, once put into production, 
runs over years
• Predictive accuracy of ML models degrades over time
• Frequent updates and retraining of models is 
necessary
