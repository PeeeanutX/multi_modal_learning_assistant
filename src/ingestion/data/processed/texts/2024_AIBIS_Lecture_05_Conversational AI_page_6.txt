Drawbacks
•
Ambiguity and complexity of human 
language (e.g., context, sarcasm, …) 
makes natural language understanding 
quite difficult
•
Natural language interaction can be more 
effortful (e.g., typing messages vs. clicking 
buttons)
•
Not everything can be communicated 
effectively through words alone (e.g., data 
analysis results)
