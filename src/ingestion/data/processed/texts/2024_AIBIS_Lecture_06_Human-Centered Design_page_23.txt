Context of Use
Identified User Needs
Patients often have to wait for treatment 
beyond the agreed time of their appointment. 
Being forced to wait is very annoying for 
patients, especially when they have to sit in the 
waiting room for up to 90 minutes without any 
clear indication of how long it will be until it is 
their turn.
The patient needs to know when their 
scheduled appointment will in fact begin 
before arriving at the doctorâ€™s office in order to
make good use of the time remaining.
Patients often make appointments well in 
advance, because good doctors are not 
available at short notice.
The patient needs to have an appointment to 
ensure they receive treatment at the agreed 
time.
