Design Principles for Ethical AI
Principle
Example Definition
Transparency
AI actors “should provide meaningful information, appropriate to the context [...] to foster a general understanding of AI 
systems, to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems [...] to enable those affected by an AI system 
to understand the outcome, and, to enable those adversely affected by an AI system to challenge its outcome [...]” 
(OECD)
Justice and 
fairness
The development, deployment and use of AI systems must be fair. […] fairness has both a substantive and a procedural 
dimension. The substantive dimension implies a commitment to: ensuring equal and just distribution of both benefits and 
costs, and ensuring that individuals and groups are free from unfair bias, discrimination and stigmatization. […] The 
procedural dimension of fairness entails the ability to contest and seek effective redress against decisions made by AI 
systems and by the humans operating them. […] (EU)
Non-maleficence
AI systems should not be used in ways that cause or exacerbate harm, whether individual or collective, and including 
harm to social, cultural, economic, natural, and political environments. (United Nations)
Responsibility
Designers and builders of advanced AI systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and 
actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications. (Future of Life Institute) 
Privacy
Artificial intelligence should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families, or communities.
