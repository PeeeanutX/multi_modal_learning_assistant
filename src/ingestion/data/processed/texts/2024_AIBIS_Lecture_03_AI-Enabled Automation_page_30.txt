Affective Responses to Software Robots 
Waizenegger & Techatassanasoontorn 2022
“Especially the fear of the robots, all 
of those movies that we've seen 
where the robots take over... so 
they're like I'm going to lose my job 
over this, you know? It's always that 
fear.”
Fear
“The team were delighted with this 
process right, because they don't want 
to sit around doing these transactions 
anyways... [...] So having such a 
repetitive manual task taken away from 
you they thought was really cool, 'cause 
then they can get on and do much more 
human add value work”
