Business Capabilities
•
Ask: What business needs and objectives can AI support? How and where 
can AI be used to enhance core business activities or enable new ones?
•
Instead of: Which data could we use for machine learning? How can we 
leverage large language models?
Business capabilities refer to the core activities and competencies 
that enable an organization to achieve its business objectives and 
deliver value to its stakeholders. (based on Margherita 2014)
