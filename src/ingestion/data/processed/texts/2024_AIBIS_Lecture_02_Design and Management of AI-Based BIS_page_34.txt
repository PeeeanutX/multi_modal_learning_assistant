•
While some organizations immediately release 
human employees, many try to avoid layoffs
•
Upskilling and reskilling are two strategies that can 
help organizations adapt to the changes caused by 
AI automation
–
Upskilling is about learning new skills to be better at 
the current job role
–
Reskilling is about learning new skills to move into a 
different job role
•
These strategies also allow organizations to develop 
talent that is not readily available in the market and 
fill existing skill gaps
