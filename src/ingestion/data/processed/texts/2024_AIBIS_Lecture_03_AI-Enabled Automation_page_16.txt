RPA bots essentially mimic human behavior by logging in with an account and password, 
entering data, clicking buttons, etc.
•
Typically, RPA bots are designed to interact with existing IT systems (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, 
SAP ERP) and perform routine tasks in a rule-based manner, such as copying and pasting data 
from one system to another

Though RPA is less “intelligent” than other AI technologies, it is usually considered part of AI, 
especially as RPA vendors are adding more intelligence to their software (e.g., integrating 
computer vision and machine learning capabilities)

Robotic process automation (RPA) enables digital processes to 
be automated through software robots (“bots”) that operate on 
the user interface in the same way as humans do.
