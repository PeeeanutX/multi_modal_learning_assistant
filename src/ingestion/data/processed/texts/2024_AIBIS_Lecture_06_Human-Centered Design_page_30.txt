UXQB 2022
Example:
“Before starting his busy workday, John Doe logs into the grocery 
delivery website. After selecting his usual items from his previous 
orders with a single click, he is prompted to reserve a delivery slot. 
He sees that his preferred delivery slot is still available and books it 
right away. John can now focus on his work, knowing that his 
groceries will arrive when it’s most convenient for him.”
