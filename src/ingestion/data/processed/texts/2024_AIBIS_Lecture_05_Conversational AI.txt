Why? →Benefits
•
Interaction via natural language is 
more intuitive compared to 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
•
Reduction of cognitive load 
•
Multi-tasking is possible:
– Hands-free situations (e.g., cooking)

[PAGE 7]
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
7
Drawbacks
•
Ambiguity and complexity of human 
language (e.g., context, sarcasm, …) 
makes natural language understanding 
quite difficult
•
Natural language interaction can be more 
effortful (e.g., typing messages vs. clicking 
buttons)
•
Not everything can be communicated 
effectively through words alone (e.g., data 
analysis results)

Main components:
–
Speech recognition: converts the speech 
input into a string of words 
–
Natural language understanding: interpret 
the user’s input and to extract a representation 
of its meaning (→“intent”)
–
Dialog management: tracks the state and flow 
of the conversation and controls how the 
system responds to the user’s input
–
Natural language generation: Formulate a 
response in natural language
–
Text-to-speech synthesis: converts the 
response string into speech output

Conversational Agents (1)
•
They can rely on different conversational AI technologies 
•
Many different terms used:
–
Dialogue systems
–
(Embodied) conversational agents
–
Chatbots/chatterbots
–
Digital/virtual assistants
–
…
Conversational agents are software-based systems designed to 
interact with humans using natural language.

Conversational Agents (2)
Conversational (Interface)
(AI) Agent
Conversational interfaces are 
interfaces that enable humans to 
interact with technology using 
written or spoken language in a 
natural way.
Agents are autonomous, active 
computer processes that possess 
some ability to communicate with 
people and/or other agents and to 
adapt their behavior.

Classes of Conversational Agents
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems
•
Conversational agents differ largely based on their mode of communication, context, level of 
embodiment, etc.
•
One classification of conversational agents based on two dimensions 
–
1) Mode of communication: text vs. voice
–
2) Context: open-domain vs. task-oriented
Context
Open-Domain
Task-Oriented

Open-Domain, Text-Based Conversational Agents 
•
Interaction via text messages (“chatting”)
•
Can basically converse about any topic 
(“open-domain”)
•
Historically, often developed to win the 
Loebner prize / to pass the Turing test

[PAGE 24]
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gnewuch
Chair of Explainable AI-based Business Information Systems

Task-Oriented, Text-Based Conversational Agents 
•
Interaction via text messages (“chatting”)
•
Designed to converse about specific 
topics and help with specific tasks in a 
specific domain
•
Examples: Customer service, healthcare, 
banking, …
•
Can be found on websites and on 
messenger platforms such as MS Teams, 
Slack, …

Open-Domain, Voice-Based Conversational Agents 
•
Interaction via spoken voice
•
Can basically answer any question and 
support users in finding information or 
accomplishing basic tasks (“open-domain”)
•
Found on many mobile devices (e.g., smart 
phones)
•
Often called personal or digital assistants
Apple‘s Siri

[PAGE 26]
•

ECAs are life‐like animated characters 
(e.g., 3D avatars) which can engage in a 
face‐to‐face conversation with humans
•
The interaction is often multimodal:

– Tone of voice
– etc.

Automated self-checkout 
cashiers and self-order kiosks 
have become omnipresent in our 
everyday lives
– Very convenient, especially for 
low involvement products (e.g., 
groceries)
•
However, in case of high 
involvement products (e.g., smart 
phones), consumers typically 
prefer to speak with and get 
advice from a human employee

•
Large language models such as GPT-4 can be used to operate a Furhat robot and hold highly 
human-like sales conversations with consumers about Bluetooth speakers
–
Some challenges remain (e.g., delays, speech recognition failures) but overall, very stable
•
Our LLM-based Furhat robot was able to create perceptions of an “emotional” or “rational” robot 
design through different natural language interaction
•
The results of our experiment with ~100 student participants show that an emotional robot design 
has negative impacts on consumers:
–
Reduces purchase likelihood (consumers are less likely to purchase the Bluetooth speaker 
recommended by Furhat)
–
Reduces recommendation adherence (consumers are less likely to follow the recommendation 
suggested by Furhat)
•
Future research: What drives the negative impact of emotional robot design?

Key Takeaways From This Lecture
•
Conversational AI is a major application area of AI-enabled 
engagement 
•
The first chatbot (Eliza) was already developed in 1966
•
Since then, the technology has evolved significantly: from 
rule-based to NLP-based to LLM-based conversational AI
•
Many different types of conversational (AI) agents exist
•
They can be classified based on the mode of 
communication (text vs. voice) and the context (open-
domain vs. task-oriented)
•
Conversational agents can be equipped with virtual 
embodiments (avatars) or physical embodiments (robots)
