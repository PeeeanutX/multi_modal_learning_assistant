Example:
“John Doe is an IT consultant who frequently shops for groceries 
online due to his busy schedule. He prefers to use the same grocery 
delivery service because it allows him to quickly reorder items from 
his past purchases. However, every so often, he forgets to check the 
delivery time slots. This often results in frustration when he realizes 
his preferred delivery window is already fully booked, causing him to 
wait much longer for groceries to arrive than expected.”
