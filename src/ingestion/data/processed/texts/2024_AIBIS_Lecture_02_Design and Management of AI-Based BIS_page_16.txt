Design as a Product
Design, used as a noun, refers to the outcome of the design 
process (“product”).
•
There is a large body of knowledge about a “good” or “ideal” design of (business) information 
systems
•
This design knowledge is captured in different forms:
–
Standards
–
Guidelines
–
Design principles
•
AI-specific design knowledge exists, but it is important to not forget about general design 
knowledge that applies to all (business) information systems
