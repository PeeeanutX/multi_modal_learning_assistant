•
Usability inspection is often performed by UX professionals or subject matter experts, who 
base their judgement on prior experience of usability problems encountered by users and their 
own knowledge of design guidelines and principles
•
Unlike usability tests and user surveys, usability inspections do not involve users
•
Why? Evaluation by users is not always possible or cost-effective at every stage of the project
