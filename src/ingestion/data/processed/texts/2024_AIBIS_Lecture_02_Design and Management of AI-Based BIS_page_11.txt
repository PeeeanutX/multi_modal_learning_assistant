Similar high-level sequence of process steps:
– Planning/analysis
– Design
– Implementation
– Operation
•
Key differences:
– Centrality of data and models that rely on data
– Focus on experimentation →many iterations at every step
– Focus on continuous improvement, even after the deployment, due to AI’s capacity to 
optimize and evolve over time
