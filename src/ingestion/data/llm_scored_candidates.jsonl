AI projects like IT projects • Assumption that ML models are just computer programs that are easy to create and modify • Expectation that a continuous delivery of results is possible • AI applications

ethics aims to address these concerns by exploring and guiding what is morally right or wrong • There are two main approaches to AI ethics • 1 ) The legislative approach focusing on top-down regulation – Example : EU AI Act • 2 ) The principled approach focusing on bottom-up “ soft laws ” – Example : Ethical AI principles such as transparency , justice and fairness , and responsibility • Both approaches have their benefits and challenges : – Regulation may impose inflexible requirements and hinder innovation – Principles are non-binding and difficult to put into practice [ PAGE 44 ]

with errors and limitations , like any other IT Managing AI projects like IT projects • Assumption that ML models are just computer programs that are easy to create and modify • Expectation that a

the exploratory and collaborative nature of AI projects The question of why • Decision makers demand explanations and prescriptions in high-stakes and uncertain situations • Legal and ethical

main approaches to AI ethics • 1 ) The legislative approach focusing on top-down regulation – Example : EU AI Act • 2 ) The principled approach focusing on bottom-up “ soft laws ” – Example : Ethical AI principles such as transparency , justice and fairness , and responsibility • Both approaches have their benefits and challenges : – Regulation may impose inflexible requirements and hinder innovation – Principles are non-binding and difficult to put into practice [ PAGE 44 ] Logo of the University of Passau Prof.", "llm_score": -4.0934882164001465}, {"doc_id": 13, "contents": "Ulrich

displacement , bias , lack of control , and privacy issues • The field of AI ethics aims to address these concerns by exploring and guiding what is morally right or wrong • There are two main approaches to AI ethics • 1 ) The legislative approach focusing on top-down regulation – Example : EU AI Act • 2 ) The principled approach focusing on bottom-up “ soft laws ” – Example : Ethical AI principles such as transparency , justice and fairness , and responsibility • Both approaches have their benefits and challenges : – Regulation may impose inflexible requirements and hinder innovation

expectations can easily lead to disappointments about the return-on-investment of AI initiatives • AI comes with errors and limitations , like any other IT Managing AI projects like IT projects • Assumption that ML models are just computer programs that are easy to create and modify • Expectation that a continuous delivery of results is possible • AI applications are learning agents , not deterministically programmed systems • Even established software development approaches can not fully account for the exploratory and collaborative nature of AI projects The question of why • Decision makers demand explanations and prescriptions in high-stakes and uncertain situations • Legal and ethical requirements demand interpretability • ML models are black boxes and based on correlations only
